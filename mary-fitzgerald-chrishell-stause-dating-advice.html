We reminded Mary, 39, that there are still catches out there, as she found a great guy in husband <strong>Romain Bonnet</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Selling-Sunset-Mary-Fitzgerald-Chrishell-Stause-single-shutterstock-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I know, I know. Yeah, my advice, is let all of us…she’s very private in her private life and so until she’s ready for things to come out…but I would say next time, just let us know who you are even thinking about so we can kind of weed out the bullsh*t first,” Mary explains, as her Selling Sunset co-stars could help Chrishell find an amazing man.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Mary says that the actress turned realtor has a lot to offer someone. It’s obvious that Chrishell is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stunningly beautiful</a>, but Mary tells us, “She’s so funny, she’s so funny. What shocked me the most is how witty she is. She’ll say stuff on the show and I’m like ‘Oh yeah, she’s pretty cute,’ like when she says stuff. But she has these witty remarks and she’s so quick. She’s a very fun person to be around.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mary-and-husband-Romain-bonnet-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>We asked Mary what the secret is to her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>happy three-year-marriage</a> to Romain. She admitted, “I think we just love and respect each other a lot. And we both have similar work ethics and like morals and values. Every relationship goes through ups and downs, but I think we’re just very aligned with what we want. And that’s each other!” Now hopefully Mary can help Chrishell find a guy who can makes her feel that loved!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FsZqaZoq56p7XTs56eqpGhsW6vx6ugrKCVobluv9OarKydXZmutbXNoGSanKaesKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kurt-bardella-wiki-biography-age-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Kurt Bardella Wiki, Biography, Age, Ethnicity, Parents, Wife, Career, Net Worth</span></a>
