A 19-year-old in Arizona was accused of raping 13 former classmates in 2014, but his lawyers are saying the girls framed him in a 'John Tucker Must Die'-inspired plot -- &nbsp;because he was 'a player.' Tyler Most, 19, was arrested in May 2014 after 13 girls between the ages of 13 and 17 accused their former classmate from&nbsp;Poston Butte High School in San Tan Valley, AZ,&nbsp;of sexual assault. But in a sinister twist, as Tyler appeared in court on Monday, April 6, investigators revealed they've&nbsp;uncovered evidence that the girls were conspiring to take down the known player -- much like the scheming ladies of the 2006 comedy&nbsp;John Tucker Must Die.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tyler-kost-arrested-john-tucker-must-die-inspiration-rape-lead-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-1683881></span></p><h3>‘John Tucker Must Die’: Girls ‘Inspired’ By Movie, Frame Peer Of Rape?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>Lawyers representing Tyler state there’s a “treasure trove” of evidence on the girls’&nbsp;Facebook and Instagram accounts&nbsp;proving they framed him, but they’re required to gather more evidence before proceeding. Defense Attorney <strong>Michael Alarid</strong> said he needs conversations between at least eight more girls to prove how far the plot went.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>A startling&nbsp;Facebook chat between three accusers and three more witnesses, reveals&nbsp;the witnesses wanted to “teach a lesson” to Tyler, referencing&nbsp;John Tucker Must Die.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Tyler needs to be taught a lesson,” it read. “We should sacrifice him to Satan.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Another girl chimed in: “I’m down…I already know this is going to be so much fun!”</p><h3>Sarah Silverman’s ‘Rape Prevention Tips’ Tweet Infuriates Male&nbsp;Fans</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Because of&nbsp;Facebook’s privacy policy, defense can’t access the other chats. As of now, the evidence shows three victims might have launched a revenge plot (<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ashanti</a></strong> appearance not included), but there’s nothing to condemn the other 10 just yet.</p><h3>Art Imitating Life? — The Girls Make ‘John Tucker Must Die’ a Reality</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tyler was charged with&nbsp;two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor for the rape of five victims; eight others then came forward. He has been sitting in jail for over a year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>But with this new information coming to light, Tyler’s situation might just be a group of girls taking the plot of a teen revenge fantasy too literally.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>John Tucker&nbsp;starred&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sophia Bush</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ashanti</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Arielle Kebbel</a></strong>&nbsp;as the girlfriends (yes, all three) of the titular John&nbsp;(<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jesse Metcalfe</a></strong>), who all find out that he’s maaaybe not the dedicated boyfriend they all dreamed. Along with their friend Kate (<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brittany Snow</a></strong>), the girls launch a campaign to make his life a living hell — telling everyone he has herpes, sneaking him a little estrogen and breaking his heart along the way.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Perhaps the girls who accused Tyler missed the message at the end, where Kate warns viewers to never try this at home — destroying someone has consequences.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — what are your&nbsp;thoughts on this case?</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>— Samantha Wilson&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH11e49xZqOnmKN6tcHCpJyrZZ2qwLV5w6KcZqypobKzecyoqq1lopa9pnnVopqtoZ2oerOx1Z6loJ1dpbmwwI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-sheen-through-the-years-two-and-a-half-men-scandals-more.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Sheen Through the Years: Two and a Half Men, Scandals, More</span></a>
