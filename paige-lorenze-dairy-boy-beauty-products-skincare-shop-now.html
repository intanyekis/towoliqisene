Whenever we see one of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Paige Lorenze</strong></a>’s posts, that’s how we feel. First, there’s the fact that she’s drop-dead gorgeous (you know the Bold Glamour filter that’s been trending on TikTok? Paige looks like that IRL but better — yes, she’s that beautiful). The content creator is also living our cottage-core, western-inspired dream life, riding horses one minute and traveling the world the next. Whether she’s going to the barn or the Australian open, Paige always dresses in her effortlessly cool style.</p><p>So naturally, we’re also fans of her brand <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dairy Boy</a>. “The brand has a much deeper meaning of comfort and nostalgia,” Paige says. “It reminds me of Vermont. It reminds me of when I used to ride horses to go say hi to the dairy cows on the other side of the stable. It reminds me of the trucker hats we wore as skiers, and how much I loved stealing boys’ oversized sweatshirts. It reminds me of how much I LOVE FARMS (ethical ones), and lastly how much I love the people and farmers who continue their family tradition of sustainably harvesting produce for their family and hometowns.”</p><p>Paige exclusively shared nine of her go-to beauty products with Us Weekly, so now we can get one step closer to achieving our Dairy Boy dreams.
