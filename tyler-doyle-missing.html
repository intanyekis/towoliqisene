Tyler Doyle is listed on his Facebook account as working for Carolina Kitchens, a local refrigeration service near Loris. Horry County Fire Rescue and North Myrtle Beach Fire Rescue are both involved with helping U.S. Coast Guard to search for the missing family members. One person was rescued earlier this evening from the north jetties between the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway, however there is no information yet regarding their condition. If anyone has any additional information regarding the whereabouts of the missing individuals they are asked to contact the U.S. Coast Guard District 7 office directly at 305-415-6800 to lend assistance in this operation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ6Suuaa%2BjJ2msqSVYrqqv9KipaBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./titus-welliver-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Titus Welliver Net Worth How Much is Welliver Worth?</span></a>
