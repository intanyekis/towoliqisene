But despite remaining successful besties all these years, there are no plans in the works for new music. “We haven’t talked about it,” Kelly said. “I literally answer this question the same way for the past I don’t know how many years. Me and the girls get together and sometimes people will never know. We are on phone calls and texts. Destiny’s Child is deeper than music which is the greatest gift, actually.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kelly-Rowland-pregnancy-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>One thing Kelly is working on during her pregnancy while at home is her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>skin care routine!</a> She teamed up with other experts in the beauty field from the comfort of their homes to host the Amazon Beauty Spotlight experience where she shared some of her favorite products. “It’s the first live virtual beauty even that they’ve done and it’s exciting because I get the opportunity to talk about beauty products which I absolutely love,” Kelly said. “Anything with retinol makes me super happy. I do not play when it comes to the sun, so SPF, really, starts my day off every morning. A good face wash. For my personally in my skin, I am not good with oil and cream based facial washes, so I like something that strips the skin and I’m able to put everything back in with serums and moisturizers or this and that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Amazon’s Treasure Truck is a fun way to shop!
