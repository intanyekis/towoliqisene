Although the Transformers films made big bucks and spawned four sequels it was panned by the critics. Battleship never got off the ground, despite a memorable appearance by <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong>. For every flop there is a LEGO Movie, which was loved by fans and critics alike, so we're not surprised Hollywood wants to make more films based on our beloved childhood toys.It felt like only a matter of time that Barbie should finally get her live-action due. The Barbie movie has been in development for years, with the likes of Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer attached to play the iconic blonde.The film finally looks like it has a cast and will make it into production. Directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie, there is a lot to be excited about when it comes to the new Barbie film. Here is everything we know:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=originally-set-to-star-amy-schumer><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Originally Set To Star Amy Schumer</span></h2><p>This live-action Barbie film has been in the works since 2014. A number of actresses have been in talks for the lead role and linked to the blonde doll in the media. Initially, it was commissioned by Sony and was set to be written by Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody and actress Amy Schumer was set to play Barbie.</p><p>Although at the time it was reported to have been scheduling conflicts that led to her leaving the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has recently revealed that it was creative difference that forced her to leave the role.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[The studio] definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,” Schumer says in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. She then goes on to explain that, she and co-writer Kim Caramele wanted Barbie to be an “ambitious inventor.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Say Amy Schumer's Critics Hate Her For Three Reasons">Fans Say Amy Schumer's Critics Hate Her For Three Reasons</a></span></p><p>“The idea that that’s just what every woman must want, right there, I should have gone, ‘You’ve got the wrong gal,’” Schumer reveals.</p><p>When Schumer pulled out in 2016, Anne Hathaway was rumored to have filled her shoes. Then in July 2019, news broke that filmmaking partners Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were set to replace Diablo Cody. Later, Margot Robbie was cast as Barbie.</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-will-star-as-barbie><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Margot Robbie Will Star As Barbie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looks like Margot Robbie will have more control of the project in comparison to Schumer, as she produces the film. Considering her LuckyChap production company helped make movies like Promising Young Woman and I,Tonya we're expecting something a bit different from this Robbie-led vehicle.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a December 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Robbie revealed some information about the role. "We like the things that feel a little left of center. Something like Barbie where the IP, the name itself, people immediately have an idea of, 'Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is,' but our goal is to be like, 'Whatever you're thinking, we're going to give you something totally different — the thing you didn't know you wanted."</p><h2 id=ryan-gosling-will-play-ken-in-barbie><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ryan Gosling Will Play Ken In 'Barbie'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was announced last year that <a href=#>Ryan Gosling will be starring as Barbie's boyfriend, Ken</a>. Little else is known about his role in the film. Apparently, Gosling at first rejected the role due to scheduling conflicts, but the delay in production made him available.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Ryan Gosling Saved His Career By Turning Down This Film">Ryan Gosling Saved His Career By Turning Down This Film</a></span></p><p>Gosling recently wrapped production on The Gray Man, the big-budget <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>action thriller from Anthony and Joe Russo.

Considering the team writing and producing the film, we expect the film to totally subvert our expectations. <a href=#>Directed Greta Gerwig and co-written by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach</a>, this real life couple is better known for making indie films like Lady Bird and Marriage Story.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Margot Robbie Had Her Face On A Double For Most Of This Film ">Margot Robbie Had Her Face On A Double For Most Of This Film</a></span></p><p>"All we can say is whatever you're thinking, it's not that," Robbie teased is an interview. <a href=#>When the The Wolf of Wall Street actress</a> was asked if the script was complete, she answered, "I can't talk about it. I want to tell you everything, I do."</p><p>During a panel at Fortune’s 2019 Brainstorm Tech conference, the executive producer of Mattel Films explained that the movie, which was still in early pre-production would push the boundaries and have a message about making dreams come true.</p><h2 id=famous-cast-for-barbie><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Famous Cast For 'Barbie'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joining Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is a host of famous faces and talented actors. On February 9, 2022, Variety first revealed that America Ferrera will star in the film alongside Gosling and Robbie. A few days later Shang Chi actor Simu Liu was added to the cast, and then <strong><a href=#>SNL </a></strong>actress Kate McKinnon also joined the project.</p><p>None of their Barbie roles have been announced yet.</p><h2 id=when-will-barbie-be-released><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>When Will 'Barbie' Be Released?</span></h2><p>The Barbie movie is in the middle of production, but it has been slated for a 2023 theatrical release.
