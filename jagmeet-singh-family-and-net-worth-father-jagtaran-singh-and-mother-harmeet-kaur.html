He is now the Leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party. He joined the New Democratic Party in 2017. Singh became the first person from a visible minority group to hold the permanent leadership of a major Canadian federal political party. He is also the first Sikh to serve as a provincial lawmaker in Ontario and the first to represent India while wearing a turban.</strong></p><p>Before becoming the Leader of the New Democratic Party, Singh was active in a variety of political undertakings. Singh worked as a criminal defense lawyer before entering politics, having graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School.</p><p>People in Canada grew more intrigued about him and his family after noticing him in various styles and attire. This post will go over all you need to know about his parents and other family members.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_of_Jagmeet_Singh_in_2023>Net Worth of Jagmeet Singh in 2023</span></h2><p>People are frequently inquisitive about the net worth of renowned people. According to sources, the net worth of Canadian politicians is believed to be $5 million, which is a substantial sum.</p><p>Singh’s principal source of income is his political career; nevertheless, he may have additional sources of income, such as investment and company, which he has yet to disclose to the public. Singh has been the New Democratic Party’s Leader since 2017 and a member of Parliament for Burnaby South since 2019.</p><h2><span id=Jagmeet_Singh8217s_parents_are_Jagtaran_Singh_and_Harmeet_Kaur>Jagmeet Singh’s parents are Jagtaran Singh and Harmeet Kaur.</span></h2><p>His father, Jagtaran Singh, and mother, Harmeet Kaur, are both from Punjab, India, where the Canadian politician was born. He was born on January 2, 1979, in Scarborough, Ontario, despite being born into an Indian family.</p><p>Jagmeet Singh (right) is seated next to his mother Harmeet Kaur (center) and father Jagtaran Singh (left). On October 1, 2017, delegates arrived in Toronto to hear the first ballot in the NDP leadership election.</p><p>He possessed Canadian citizenship but returned to India, where his parents were born. Singh was reared by his grandparents as a youngster, and after a few years, he moved back to Canada with his parents. Before he was born, Jagtaran and Harmmet moved to Canada; his parents have been permanent residents of India since he was born.</p><p>Although everyone knows a lot about the politician, there has never been much information about his parents.</p><h2><span id=Jagmeet_Singh8217s_Family_Tree>Jagmeet Singh’s Family Tree</span></h2><p>Jagmeet Singh was born into an Indian household where all of his great-grandparents were political activists. His great-grandfather, Sewa Singh Thikriwal, was prominent in the Indian Independence Campaign in the 1990s.</p><p>He also had another great-grandfather, Hira Singh, who fought in the Army during World War I and II. Hira belonged to the British-Indian Army. Singh is delighted to be able to follow in his grandparents’ footsteps and fight for the greater good and human rights.</p><p>When it comes to his family, he was reared with two younger siblings, Gurratan and Manjot Singh. His brother Gurratan, like Jagmeet, is a former Canadian politician. Gurratan was elected to the Ontario Legislative Assembly in 2018.</p><p>There is no public information available on her sister, Manjot Singh. His siblings were both born in Newfoundland. Jagmeet has his own family as well; he is a married man with a daughter born in 2022.
