“To make a stressful situation even more stressful, my wife’s due date was the same day as my first day of shooting,” Kota explained, noting that the couple’s decision to induce labor a week early didn’t go as planned."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While South Asian culture may be associated with arranged marriages, Indian matchmaking is not necessarily that anymore,” Kota, <a href=#>who is Indian American</a>, explained. “Matchmaking has evolved. Just like modern dating [like dating apps], clients are matched based on characteristics like shared interests, physical attraction, age, location.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Never Have I Ever</a> actor told Us that couples who use matchmakers “may progress faster to marriage because things like astrological alignment and the vetting process between the families happens upfront.”</p><p>Kota added: “What the movie does well is highlight how traditional matchmaking can be modernized and made accessible to everyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmuq5ieeqy705pkrKCfqXqprculpJqqm6h6rq3KnmSmnV2Weq6t05yfZpyRrsBurcWtnKtlo6S7tHnBoqmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-jessica-simpson-sick-what-happened-to-jessica-simpson-2022-how-did-jessica-simpson-lose-weight-2022-does-jessica-simpson-brush-her-teeth-now-473530-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Jessica Simpson Sick?
