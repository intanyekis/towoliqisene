Most of the German employees in the meeting took offense to his actions, mainly because it is prohibited in Germany to use the symbol outside of artistic purposes.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the controversial musician</a> had allegedly “advised” a Jewish <a href=# id=auto-tag_adidas data-tag=adidas>Adidas</a> employee “to kiss a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> picture of Hitler every day</a>.” The visionary also reportedly forced Adidas executives to “watch pornography” for inspirational purposes.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The Times&nbsp;found [that] Mr. West made Adidas executives watch pornography during a meeting at his Manhattan apartment, ostensibly to spark creativity,” the report reads. “In February 2015, preparing to show the first Yeezy collection at New York Fashion Week, staff members complained that he had upset them<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with angry, sexually crude comments.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-543615202.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cur8XEZq6eq6Rif3F9lWaknqaklrlurtGemKScn6y7bn2RbGtxaGZugnh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./e-40-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>E-40 Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
