Because of this, he has already made a sizable impact on Hollywood and is something of a household name now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Butler's original claim to fame was appearing on Hannah Montana, as well as his relationship with actress Vanessa Hudgens. Their relationship timeline spanned nearly a decade and was famous for the couple's public appearances, occasional scandals, and their mysterious private ending.</p><p>Since then, Butler has moved on to dating Kaia Gerber. Here's how Hudgens feels about her ex moving on.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-austin-butler-and-vanessa-hudgens>What Happened Between Austin Butler And Vanessa Hudgens?</h2><p>Butler and Hudgens were a couple that captured the hearts of many fans. They were together for over a decade, which is rare in modern Hollywood. They supported each other's careers and were always there for one another when times get tough, and it seemed like their relationship was going to successfully face the tests of both time and fame. Unfortunately, that just wouldn't be the case in the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Is-Vanessa-Hudgens-Still-On-Good-Terms-With-Her-Ex-Boyfriends.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nicki Swift</a>, Hudgens and Butler reportedly met through Hudgens’ friend and co-star Ashley Tisdale, who appeared with Butler in her High School Musical spin-off, Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure. It wasn’t too long before the two of them were spotted hanging out at Tisdale’s sister’s birthday party in Hollywood in September 2011, showing off a little PDA.</p><p>It wasn't a long time before they showed up on red carpets together. There wasn't a lot of drama while they were dating. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CNN</a>, the two were accused of vandalism, but that's truthfully about it. They were just in love with each other, simple as that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the news of their break-up came out, it left fans and media outlets in shock. Their break-up served fans as a reminder that even the strongest relationships can come to an end. Here's exactly what happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/austin-butler-and-vanessa-hudgens-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Cosmopolitan</a>, they primarily broke up because of their busy schedules. Butler was beginning to star in Tarantino films and Elvis, so it makes sense why two A-list stars would struggle to find time for each other.</p><p>It's a common belief that communication and scheduling are two of the most important obstacles in a relationship, and Butler and Hudgens' relationship would ultimately meet its demise because of those things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-austin-butler-39-s-relationship-with-kaia-gerber>Everything To Know About Austin Butler's Relationship With Kaia Gerber</h2><p>Butler and Gerber first sparked dating rumors in December 2021 after they attended a yoga class together.

She's been in movies like Babylon and Holidate, and has also walked in fashion shows for brands like Chanel and Versace. Despite their different backgrounds, Gerber and Butler have found common ground in the entertainment industry. As their careers continue to flourish, fans are excited to see if these two lovers will ever act together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kaia Gerber And Austin Butler's Relationship History, Explained</a></span></p><p>According to BuzzFeed, Butler has declined to answer questions about Gerber in any interviews. He may not say much, but has Hudgens said anything?</p><h2 id=how-does-vanessa-hudgens-truly-feel-about-kaia-gerber>How Does Vanessa Hudgens Truly Feel About Kaia Gerber?</h2><p>Hudgens actually has commented on Gerber and Butler's relationship, if only behind closed doors. According to an insider who informed Life & Style Magazine, Hudgens is “totally cool” about Butler and Gerber.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Vanessa Hudgens' Boyfriends Have Said About Being In A Relationship With Her</a></span></p><p>Aside from some social media shoutouts, Hudgens has refrained from talking about Butler at all. She did post on Instagram about how Butler's Elvis accent is impressive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/baz-luhrmann-and-austin-butler.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Butler, on the other hand, has commented about Hudgens and their break-up. In an interview with GQ for their June 2022 cover story, Butler was asked about the split and replied, “Life is full of changes, and you’ve got to find a way to constantly be evolving and growing". He did kind of skirt around talking about Hudgens specifically, but things seem to be okay all around.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hudgens is dating a baseball player named Cole Tucker. The couple made their relationship Instagram official in February 2021, sharing sweet pictures of each other on their respective accounts.</p><p>For those who are unaware of Tucker, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2014 and made his Major League debut on April 20, 2019. Since then, he's become a standout player for a rising Pirates team. Both on and off the field, he's had major success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/10-1.jpg><p>Butler has not publicly expressed any feelings toward Tucker whatsoever. It is unclear if the two have ever met or interacted in any way, but if Butler has truly moved on from Hudgens, he probably isn't too upset with Hudgens and Tucker's relationship.</p><p>In 2023, it is expected that Butler will continue to rise in prominence and take on even more challenging roles as an actor. After being nominated for an Oscar for portraying Elvis, Butler is expected to appear in Dune: Part Two.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Butler has also been pursuing his passion for music. He released his debut single "Break The Rules" in 2021 for the Elvis film and has been working on new music ever since per TMZ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hudgens has been cheering on Tucker at some of his Pirates games. According to IMDb, she is going to star in Netflix's "Tick, Tick...Boom!" alongside Lin-Manual Miranda. She, too, has been working on music and her social media influencer career. <a href=#>Considering her already high net worth</a>, she doesn't even need to work if she doesn't want to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqtdq66vsdKsmGagpZm0prrSZqqaoZRirq%2FF06Ggp59dlq%2BwwdNmmK6rpJ67bq7UraOeql2ctrO4xaugnqaUYriitcBmnp6qkpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diane-kruger-daughter-html.html><span>←</span><span>Diane Kruger Was Overjoyed to Welcome Daughter in Her 40s</span></a>
