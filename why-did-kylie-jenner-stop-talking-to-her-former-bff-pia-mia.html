From the glitzy events around Hollywood to award shows, birthday parties, luxury getaway trips, to even staying at her multi-million dollar home in Hidden Hills, California, Pia had quite a life being friends with the lip kit queen.</p><p>Kylie has been documenting her day-to-day activities on social media for a while now, but in 2014, she started using Snapchat on a frequent basis, allowing fans to get an insight look into her life.</p><p>Again, Pia was often seen in the video clips as they traveled around the country and would enjoy sleepover parties with their mutual friends.</p><p>By 2016, however, it seemed as their three-year close ties had come to an end as Kylie stopped posting her pal on social media.</p><p>While some reports claimed they had a falling out and were no longer on speaking terms, it was also rumored that the two may have been feuding over Kanye West or Tyga, who was Kylie’s boyfriend at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian Snubs Scott Disick After Rumors She’s Dating Travis Barker</a></span></p><p>What also seemed to confirm a rivalry between both ladies was the fact that Pia was no invited to Kylie’s baby shower when she geared up to birth her daughter, Stormi Webster, whom she shares with rapper Travis Scott.</p><p>We should probably mention that in 2015, Pia made headlines when she was alleged to have gotten too close for comfort with West — a claim which she has strongly denied — and interestingly enough, her friendship with Kylie ended just a few months later.</p><p>"Kanye thinks she's young, fresh and hip … Totally his target audience,” a source told Radar Online at the time. “He's been consulting her on a lot of his creative projects, including the Kanye x APC collection.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Kanye's creative team was pretty shocked that he would use a teenager as his confidante. And Kim was actually kind of agitated by it, because he doesn't usually want her input on design stuff. She was a little jealous.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner Trolled ‘For Having Too Much Surgery’ As Candid Vacation Snaps Emerge</a></span></p><p>In response to those accusations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pia defended herself</a>, saying, "Kylie and her family are good friends of mine, I tried to ignore the media, but let me make it clear, the stories are completely false.”</p><p>And while it’s no secret that she no longer shares that close of a bond with Kylie, Pia had nothing but positive things to say about the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> back in 2019.</p><p>When asked about what she made on Kylie welcoming her baby girl the year prior, Pia gushed, "Well, I always remember, you know, Kylie saying she always wanted to be a mom and she really felt like that's what she was meant to do in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, I feel like it really didn't change. Like, Kylie is so mothering and she's just such a sweet, loving person in general and I just think that now it's just more, maybe.”</p><p>Pia went on to tell the publication that she did attend Stormi’s first birthday party when Travis went above and beyond to create an Astro-themed carnival bash for his little girl.</p><p>The event reportedly cost over $200,000 to put together.</p><p>"Stormi is so cute," she continued. "I saw her for her first birthday and they did the whole carnival Astro storm. It was amazing. She's the sweetest thing ever.”</p><p>"I got her a little -- I always go to sleep with a star projector," she explains. "When I fall asleep, it lights up my room and it makes it look like there's stars and so I got her the same thing. Because I thought she would like to fall asleep with the stars too.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian Will ‘Confirm Marriage Split’ On The Next Season Of ‘KUWTK’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecqyo6KdXZ%2Byr7rEq2SsrJ%2BlerWty6Sgp59dqbxutMSrZJ%2BnoqKys3nBn51mqJmWeq61wGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-are-bruce-toussaint-famille-from-origin-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Where Are Bruce Toussaint Famille From?
