The 25-year-old put himself in a promising spot after a rapid ascension to stardom and success.</p><p>The Chiefs were eager to reward Mahomes for his performance but downplayed the situation. Behind the scenes, the team quickly worked out a record-breaking extension with their star quarterback. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to ESPN</a>, the two sides agreed to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an astounding 10-year extension for $450 million, worth up to $503 million.</a> The contract locked him in with Kansas City through the 2031 season. Here's how Mahomes spends his fortune.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Stealing Home: The Ten Biggest Contracts In Baseball History</a></span></p><h2 id=staying-close-to-his-roots>Staying Close To His Roots</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, it should come as no surprise that Mahomes<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> is setting up some long-term roots in Kansas City.</a> Mahomes' first big expenditure was actually an investment, spending some of his $503 million to buy a stake in the Kansas City Royals, becoming the youngest owner in MLB history.</p><p>"I love this city and the people of this great town. This opportunity allows me to deepen my roots in this community, which is something I'm excited to do." Mahomes said in a statement.</p><p>Now that Mahomes had significant ties to the city, he would need what all wealthy football players need, a multi-million-dollar mansion for his fiancée, newborn baby daughter, and Super Bowl LIV trophy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mahomes purchased <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a relatively modest home for what an athlete is capable of affording</a> after his record-breaking contract. The pad is located in the Sunset Hills West neighborhood of Kansas City in an upscale private community and reportedly set him back $1.9 million. The 4,343 square foot home sits on a 1.4-acre lot by the Country Club District and incorporates modern block architecture into a typical clapboard-siding ranch house. There is a 500-bottle wine room, a chef's kitchen, a wet bar, and Mahomes reportedly spent $500,000 adding a personal gym and a custom closet.</p><h2 id=a-custom-closet-full-of-shoes>A Custom Closet Full Of Shoes</h2><p>What goes inside of the closet of a man who just scored one of the biggest contracts in sports? The custom closet is outfitted with display lights, shelves to hold his sneakers, and racks for his sunglasses. There's even a security camera. "That's mostly for my brother," Mahomes joked: "I know he'll try to be in my shoe closet… I can look to make sure all my shoes are still here."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CNBC</a>, Mahomes <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stocks this closet with quite the collection of shoes</a>, which is made up of 180 pairs. Among the shoes are several styles from Adidas, his sponsor since 2017, and includes the pair he wore during his first photo shoot. He also has a Game of Thrones-inspired pair called the 'Night's Watch Ultraboost' and a handful of customized ones, with phrases like 'NYC', 'ATL', and 'Pharrell Williams' inscribed on the back.</p><h2 id=the-one-for-luxurious-surprises>The One For Luxurious Surprises</h2><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What kind of cars</a> did Mahomes opt to put in his driveway after his record payday? A Ferrari 812 Superfast, which<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> according to Car Collector's Club</a>, starts at a whopping $338,000. That may sound like a lot of money to you and me, but for the Chiefs' quarterback, it's only a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Mahomes also surprised his fiancée Brittany Matthews with a brand-new Lamborghini. While she hasn't revealed what model vehicle she has received, TMZ speculated it resembled a Lamborghini Urus, worth more than $200,000. Not too shabby for what Mathews has called her 'mom car'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He didn't just surprise her with a car though, one of his latest purchases is a massive engagement ring given to Mathews when he proposed. The couple had been dating since high school, and Mahomes decided it was finally time to pop the question, it is unclear the exact details of the ring, but it is estimated that the gem is an 8 to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10-carat emerald cut diamond set on a white gold </a>or a platinum diamond-adorned double band which could have cost him something around $800,000.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Guy Fieri Gets $50 Million Raise With New Contract, Now One Of The Highest Paid TV Hosts</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheList</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car Collector's Club</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMqZitqpmYuG65wKGmpp2jYsGpsYyhoKCglajBbrzAoptmppaherG4wLKcq2WjpbKvsNJmn6KrXaK2rbjIqKWsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samantha-harris.html><span>←</span><span>Getting To Know Samantha Harris</span></a>
