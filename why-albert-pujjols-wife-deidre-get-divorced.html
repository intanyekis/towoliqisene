Aside from the emotional finish to a Hall of Fame-worthy career, he's also had to deal with some personal drama, including a divorce from his long-time wife Deidre.</p><p>Despite being an athlete for a sport that some say is dying out, Albert has remained a superstar over the last few decades. His impeccable skill on the field has drawn millions of fans, many of whom have wondered about his personal life. While the Pujolo family historically kept their persona life on the down-low, the athlete surprised fans when he filed for divorce in April 2022. Since then, Albert and Deidre have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">finalized their divorce, but not without a lot of drama</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lionel-messi-s-wife-antonela-roccuzzo-suffered-from-a-terrifying-illness-while-she-was-pregnant-with-their-son.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lionel Messi's Wife Antonela Roccuzzo Suffered From A Terrifying Illness While She Was Pregnant With Their Son</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lionel Messi's wife Antonella Roccuzzo's health problem during her pregnancy was something no one saw coming.</span><h2 id=albert-pujol-filed-for-divorce-before-his-wife-39-s-brain-surgery><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Albert Pujol Filed For Divorce Before His Wife's Brain Surgery</span></h2><p>For a long time, it seemed like Albert was living it up both on and off the field. In reality, he actually was. His family life was seemingly perfect throughout his tenured career. That was, until both his career and marriage met their end around the same time.</p><p>An interesting fact is that Deidre has played a huge part in Albert's religious life. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert converted completely to his faith of Christianity because of multiple family members</a>, including Deidre, who was a devout Christian. They said it was a cornerstone of their relationship.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tom-brady-and-gisele-bunchen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Athletes Went On To Marry The Top Supermodels In The World</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Athletes often make headlines when they tie the knot with supermodels.</span><p>Together, Albert and Deidre have had four children. Deidre actually had another child named Isabella before she met Albert, but Albert took her in as his own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All seemed to be going well for the couple until opening Day for the 2022 Cardinals. With the return of Albert and a destined playoff spot, many fans were hyped for the upcoming season. However, he shocked fans by announcing his divorce from Deidre around the same time. But that wasn't the only thing shocking about the timing of Albert's decision to call their marriage off. It was also just days after Deidre had surgery for brain tumor removal.</p><p>Following Albert's filing, Deidre didn't say too much publicly regarding the divorce. What she did say was mostly positive, like when she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced her unconditional support</a> for her husband on the baseball field. On the flip side, she has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">requested Albert pay up for child support</a>.</p><h2 id=why-did-albert-and-deidre-pujols-divorce-after-20-years-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Why Did Albert And Deidre Pujols Divorce After 20 Years Together?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-10-21-at-2-39-57-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the divorce documents, Albert listed their separation date as February 16th, 2022. Like a lot of information involving Deidre, she hasn't publicly revealed much. However, Albert claimed in the initial divorce papers that they were splitting for "irreconcilable differences". In a public statement, Deidre asked for privacy for both her and her family. Otherwise, neither Albert nor Deidre have released ay further details about what led to the dissolution of their marriage.</p><p>The exes went on to quickly (and quietly) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">settle their divorce in August 2023</a>. They agreed that Deidre will keep their kids 70% of the time, and she'll receive nearly $20,000 in monthly child support. Albert also agreed to give their adult daughter Isabella $5,000 a month until he can earn a living on her own. As per the divorce agreement, Albert will retain ownership of several of their properties as well as possession of his car collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So much for heartbreak, as Albert's already moved on from his marriage. Since late 2020, he's been in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship with a woman named Nicole Fernandez</a>. She's not that famous in the sense that she doesn't end up on magazine covers, but she is a highly famous and influential person in other parts of the world. This is because she is actually the daughter of Leonel Fernandez, the former president of the Dominican Republic. He was seen as highly influential, and had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praises from President Obama</a>.</p><p>It appears that Albert and Nicole remain happily together, while his ex-wife is living her newfound single life out of the spotlight.</p><h2 id=albert-pujol-39-s-wife-deidre-supported-his-rise-in-the-mlb><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Albert Pujol's Wife Deidre Supported His Rise In The MLB</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-10-21-at-2-39-22-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Albert Pujols found himself playing on teams such as the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels, and Los Angeles Dodgers. When he was with the Angels, he got to play with sensational players including Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani, the latter of whom is considered to be this generation's Babe Ruth.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tom-Holland-.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tom Holland Spills On Being Star-Struck By Athletes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Spider-Man star Tom Holland has confessed he loves meeting athletes.</span><p>Baseball might not be the most popular sport nowadays, but it still has a huge impact on sports and media. Athletes from other sports grew up playing baseball and incorporated lessons learned from Baseball into their game. There are <a href=#>mega-rich superstars like Michael Jordan</a> who played legitimate baseball for a period of their career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all of that, Albert has made quite the name for himself in what's supposed to be a dying sport. One of the more respected athletes of his generation, Albert has gained respect due to his honesty. He has Barry Bonds numbers without taking steroids, which is both impressive and admirable. There have been many legendary players who have put up numbers like Albert's, but because of cheating have been blackballed from the sport. These guys still struggle to make it into the Hall of Fame, despite having the right credentials.</p><p>Throughout his career, Deidre seemed to be a source of support for Albert during his rise to MLB, that is until their divorce announcement that shocked fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlrmjsdGtZKmtmp%2B8rb%2BMsKCfnV2Zsqqw0Z5koJ2kYrGqws6rmp6cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drew-houston-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Drew Houston Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
