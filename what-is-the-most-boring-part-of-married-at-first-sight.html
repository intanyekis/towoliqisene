After the honeymoons are over, viewers watch as the real drama that is bound to pull some of the couples apart is on full display. When the couples are on their honeymoons, that almost always is the most boring part of the season. The reason for that is because most of the participants are on their best behavior so it is much more unlikely that anything interesting will happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Married-at-First-Sight-season-14-promo-shoot1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaqVlrFww8eaq2aho2LBqbGMpqasrF2XvLO1zaBkqZmiqXqwsoymmKuqmZqxbq3TZp2iqqOperS1xqGraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-what-fans-really-think-about-coraline-and-how-scary-it-is.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What Fans Really Think About 'Coraline' And How Scary It Is</span></a>
