In this article, we will explore Vicki Gunvalson’s biography, career, personal life, and net worth in 2023.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h3><p>Vicki Gunvalson was born as Victoria L. Steinmetz on March 27, 1962, in Chicago, Illinois, USA. She grew up in a middle-class family with four siblings. Her father owned a construction company and her mother was a housewife. Vicki learned the value of hard work and financial responsibility from her father, who gave her her first job at Swenson’s Ice Cream Shop when she was 14. She then worked at Wendy’s and Jewel Food Stores while attending Fremd High School in Palatine, Illinois.</p><p>Vicki married her first husband Michael J. Wolfsmith when she was 21 and they had two children, Michael and Briana. At the age of 29, they divorced and Vicki became a single mother. She took a part-time job at her father’s construction company as an accountant to make ends meet. Her father passed away from Alzheimer’s disease in 1991, which motivated Vicki to pursue a career in the insurance industry. She got licensed to sell life and health insurance and joined a captive insurance company as an agent. Within a year, she became the top salesperson of the company.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career and Business</strong></h3><p>In 1994, Vicki moved from Chicago to Coto de Caza, California, and married Donn Gunvalson.

She hosted a podcast called Whoop It Up with Vicki (2020), where she interviewed celebrities, experts, and friends about various topics.
