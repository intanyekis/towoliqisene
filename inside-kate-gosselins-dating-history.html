<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Inside Kate Gosselin's Dating History</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Kate Gosselin's romantic life throughout the years: The television star has been married and divorced once! &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Best known for starring in the reality television series, <i>Jon & Kate Plus 8,</i> which ran for eleven successful seasons, from 2007 to 2017, <strong>Kate Gosselin</strong> is a television personality, writer, and former nurse. Gosselin's television credits also include <i>Dancing with the Stars, Celebrity Wife Swap, The View,</i> and <i>Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.</i> &nbsp;</p><p>Born Katie Irene "Kate" Kreider on March 28, 1975, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she worked as a nurse before being introduced to the nation for her rare case. Gosselin's atypical family of twins and sextuplets, making for eight kids in total, propelled a new-found interest in the audience, catapulting Kate and her family to become household faces.&nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Kate Gosselin and Jon Gosselin's Marriage! &nbsp;</h3><p>Kate's family life was the epitome of an ideal traditional family for a long time. Kate's devout Christian fans even looked up to the television star and her conventional ways. Gosselin was first introduced to TLC's viewers as the wife of <strong>Jon Gosselin. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/21/17818206_792031200965137_7127382066026512384_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689955764300.jpg><p>The duo's titular show premiered in 2007 and it saw the Gosselin couple navigate their public persona from being a traditional household to a much-scrutinized family. Kate married Jon in June 1999 and welcomed eight children, twin girls <strong>Mady </strong>and<strong> Cara,</strong> 22, and sextuplets: <strong>Alexis, Hannah, Aaden, Collin, Leah,</strong> and <strong>Joel</strong>, 19.</p><p>Fans soon learned that the Gosselin family was only perfect on the surface and signs of trouble started showing on and off screen. The seemingly enviable couple was speculated to have cheated on each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/21/19933326_294788580992061_4884963311319252992_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689955785916.jpg><p>While Kate was linked with her family's bodyguard, <strong>Steve Neild,</strong> Jon was speculated to have had an affair with <strong>Deanna Hummel</strong>, a school teacher. Although the TLC stars denied the allegations, they proceeded with their split.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/21/17932228_664187943774370_4192913049071386624_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689955948591.jpg><p>Over the course of this weekend, Jon's activities have left me no choice but to file legal procedures in order to protect myself and our children," Kate wrote in her statement as she filed to divorce Jon. Kate and Jon separated in 2009 and the TLC show took a massive plot turn as it followed the estranged duo in their nasty custody battle and an overpublicized divorce process. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The estranged couple's joint venture on TLC came to an end in January 2010 after Jon stopped filming for the show. Whereas, Kate and her kids continued to rake in fame and fortune after the show was named <i>Kate Plus 8</i>, focusing on the divorcee mother's solo journey, upon Jon's exit. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/21/275941862_979916356247163_6554360936520380332_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689955817575.jpg><p>Kate and Jon were embroiled in a public custody battle for years. Both parties made vile accusations against each other to bring the case in their favor. "You can't breathe the wrong way without upsetting her," Jon said about his ex-wife's parenting. Jon won the custody of two of the eight kids and went estranged from the rest. &nbsp;</p><p>The TLC alum and distressed father recently opened up about not having access to most of his kids. "I have no access to the kids I'm estranged from," Jon said in Vice's <i>Dark Side of the 2000s </i>latest episode, <i>Jon & Kate Plus 8: Family Circus.</i> "I have no closure," <a href=#>said</a> the father of eight. &nbsp;</p><h3>Kate Gosselin's Love Life After Divorce! &nbsp;</h3><p>After her marriage with Jon dissolved, Kate is either keeping her love life very discreet or has completely withdrawn herself from the pool. The nurse-turned-television personality hasn't sparked dating rumors for years. Amid her divorce proceedings, Kate was briefly linked with Steve Neild, with whom she allegedly had an affair. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/21/55776552_374013836782159_7533454116630491953_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689956076296.jpg><p>The <i>Jon & Kate Plus 8</i> star started dating millionaire<strong> Jeff Prescott</strong> in early 2015. The couple only became more forthcoming about their romance as months unfolded and were even snapped on a few PDA-filled getaways. Gosselin reportedly even convinced Prescott to appear in her reality show, <i>Kate Plus 8.</i> But things fizzled out before the two could take it onscreen. &nbsp;</p><p>The weather entrepreneur dumped Kate in September for a 26-year-old. Several<a href=#> sources </a>shared that Gosselin was pretty upset about their split as she felt that she shared a special connection with the millionaire. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kate's ex-beau, Prescott, allegedly dumped her for a younger girl!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The mother of eight is believed to be single as of this writing. And Kate's ex-husband, Jon, 46, started dating a registered nurse named <strong>Colleen Conrad</strong> in 2015 and broke up with her in 2021. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqsrdOeZKCno6iyrbXNrGSdmaSeu6h5x6Kqraeirg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-asamoah-frimpong.html><span>←</span><span>Eric Asamoah-Frimpong</span></a>
