As two people known for being in the spotlight, it’s surprising to know they kept their love under wraps for six months, but now that the news is out, we can’t wait to see where these new lovebirds go from here!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5ye5BsZqCklaN6sbvWnqOlZZSWwaq6xmapnqaVmnqjrdGgn2amlax6pLvUqaOeZaKavbC%2B02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-latifah-pays-show-staff-with-own-money-247838.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Latifah Pays Laid-Off Talk Show Staff With Her Own Money</span></a>
