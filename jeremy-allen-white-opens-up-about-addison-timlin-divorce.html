Four months after the initial filing, White agreed to <a href=#>undergo alcohol testing</a> as part of his joint custody agreement with Timlin. The actor agreed to be tested for alcohol five times a week when caring for his daughters and must attend individual therapy once a week in addition to at least two weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jeremy-Allen-White-Shares-He-Felt-Terribly-Low-Lows-Amid-Divorce-inline.jpg><p>As White and Timlin navigate their new normal, the parents have put on a united front for their children, attending several of their kid’s soccer games together. Recently, Timlin shared a <a href=#>heartfelt tribute</a> in honor of Ezer’s 5th birthday.</p><p>“Maybe 5 is this very precious and precarious time where we’re close enough to remember and 5 enough to forge our own path. It feels like this gentle departure,” she wrote via Instagram alongside a slideshow of photos of her little one. “From baby to kid. From new mom to mother. The littlest letting go. You tell me stories that are so long and nuanced now, you say things like ‘I can’t remember his name, so let’s call him John.’ You have the best sense of humor and the best laugh.”</p><p>White replied to the sweet message in the comments section, writing, “Sweetest girl in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since his split from Timlin, White has moved on with model <a href=#><strong>Ashley Moore</strong></a>. The couple were first spotted packing on the PDA in August, but a source exclusively told Us at the time that White and Moore, 30, aren’t serious and are just <a href=#>enjoying their time together</a>.</p><p>“Jeremy and Ashley aren’t putting any labels on their relationship, but they’re hooking up as often as they can and are totally smitten,” the insider shared, noting that the duo’s chemistry is “off the charts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaKaurp5wKWjnqZdrLWqwMRmpqmdnqh6tryMmpmoraRirqWwyKymp2Wknrqttc1mm6Kun6ewpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./catherine-jordan-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Catherine Jordan Obituary: In Loving Memory Of Catherine Jordan, Greenville, SC</span></a>
