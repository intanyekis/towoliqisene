Davis, left-handers Thomas Szapucki and Nick Zwack and right-hander Carson Seymour to the Giants to get him.</p><p>“Anywhere you struggle, fans are going to be tough on you but in New York, it’s magnified,” Ruf, <a href=#>who rejoined the Giants</a> on a minor league deal on Saturday, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Athletic</a>. “I think the media there really runs with what fans’ perceptions are. So you’re kind of getting crushed by two entities. Even if you’re not on social media a heck of a lot, you still have an idea and you see things.”</p><p>Ruf has good career numbers against left-handers, having hit .272 with an .891 OPS, 39 home runs, and 102 RBIs in 706 career plate appearances against lefties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/081222Mets079CW.jpg><p>Over his last 22 regular-season games, Ruf was 4-for-48 against all pitchers with 16 strikeouts.</p><p>He started at DH in Game 2 of the Mets’ wild-card series against the Padres on Oct. 8, going 0-for-1 with a walk and a strikeout, and he was removed for a pinch-runner in the sixth after being hit by a pitch.</p><p>Ruf played most of last season with a heavy heart as his father, Bill, died in late May.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Want to catch a game?

When a lot of things get thrown your way at once, it’s hard to perform every single night on a stage like New York or really anywhere in Major League Baseball.</p><p>“Baseball is a very tough game and you have to be in a very good spot mentally to have success. I’m hoping I can get back to that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/20220914_MetsCubs028CS.jpg><p>Ruf hopes to regain the form he had with the Giants in 2021, when he slashed .283/.414/.593 against left-handers.</p><p>“I am very happy to be back,” Ruf said. “Last year … it didn’t go the way I personally wanted it to. Obviously not for the Giants as a team, either. And getting traded didn’t work out the way anyone wanted.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21mamlfma6ztc1mqa6eXaS9prrSZqypZZ%2Bjeqix062gp59dmL%2B2v8eem2aaqWK6psDSZp2apqNiuqawyJpm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cole-hamelss-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Cole Hamelss biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story</span></a>
