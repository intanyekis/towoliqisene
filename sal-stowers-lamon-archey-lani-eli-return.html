Unfortunately,&nbsp; good things sometimes also come to those who’ve just gotten bad news, as is about to be the cruelly ironic case for Paulina.</p><p>If you watched the episode which aired on Monday, February 19, you know that things seemed to be on the upswing for Paulina. Kayla reported that the surgery had been successful and all of the cancer had been removed. Sure, it would be a few days before she could engage in one of her favorite pastimes — talking! — but otherwise, Paulina appeared to be in the clear.</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong>Another pair of iconic characters is set to return to Salem</p><p>Yet by episode’s end, she went from wincing to practically convulsing in pain. Clearly, she’s not out of the woods yet. And based on teasers for what’s set to unfold in Salem next week, things are going to get worse before they get better. At the beginning of the week, several of those closest to her will get bad news from Paulina. How bad? Well… bad enough that on Thursday, February 29, Eli and Lani will be returning to the canvas.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JPI_dool2322_0001959413.jpg alt='Lamon Archey, Sal Stowers"Days of our Lives" SetNBC StudiosBurbank2/03/22© XJJohnson/jpistudios.com310-657-9661' width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Viewers know that Lani was sent to prison after murdering her biological father in order to protect mom Paulina. Not long after, Eli wound up moving so that he and their adorable twins could be closer to the prison to which their mom had been sentenced. That was way back in July of 2022. Lani did return in 2023 after Abe, whom she’d for several years mistakenly believed to be her dad, was wrongly believed dead thanks to the antics of his kidnapper, the unbalanced Whitley. As for Eli, he’s popped into town on a couple occasions (giving everyone a chance to catch a glimpse of kids Carver and Jules!).</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Days is about to do a time-jump</a></p><p>It goes without saying that having Lani by her side during this difficult period will mean the world to Paulina, especially given all they’ve been through. (You’ll recall that not only did Lani have to deal with the fact that Abe wasn’t her father, but that her beloved “Aunt” Paulina was actually her mom!)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/JPI_Episode14341_0001951327-e1653071423893.jpg alt="Sal Stowers, Jackee Harry lani paulina hug handcuffs police station jpi days" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There’s no word yet as to how long Lani and Eli will remain in town or how the family reunion will play out. Since exiting the show, Stowers has kept extremely busy, between getting engaged and doing a guest arc on Tyler Perry’s primetime soap&nbsp;Sistas. And of course, Archey became a recurring cast member on the series&nbsp;All American&nbsp;and starred in the twisty-turny Lifetime thriller&nbsp;Every Breath She Takes as the new beau of a woman who may or may not have murdered her husband (who may or may not actually be dead).</p><p><strong>Check out this photo-filled gallery of all the other <a href=# rel=noopener>stars who are returning</a> (or recently returned) to Days of Our Lives!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOnKamoZ6cwG6tzZ1koKeZo7S0e5Zqb25oZWTAoriMrKuor5WnwG64wKamp2WRp7Cpsdhmo5qmmWKyrbWMq5ytraKjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheslin-kolbe-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Cheslin Kolbe Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
