The remarks weren't malicious, but they stood out, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the NFL player responded to them with good humor</a>.</p><p><strong>On their podcast, Jason Kelce and Travis had new Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley as a guest, and the three of them joked about their weight</strong>.</p><p>When Saquon Barkley asked the brothers who would win in a drinking game between the two of them, Jason quickly replied saying he was bigger. "I can definitely drink more volume, I don't even think that's a question."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To that, Travis replied that the retired player was "already down to 260", but Jason corrected him saying he actually weighed 283 pounds. <strong>That's when Travis referenced his weight gain in the off season, saying "We're in the same weight class now. It's March! We're in the same weight class right now."</strong></p><p>They made one more reference to Travis and Taylor when Saquon Barkley talked about wanting to be "the next Apollo Creed". <strong>Jason Kelce said to him to just "throw it out there" because "stuff happens when it goes out on New Heights". He was, of course, referring to the time Travis Kelce mentioned he wanted to give Taylor Swift his phone number in a friendship bracelet.</strong> The rest, of course, is history.</p><h2 id=jason-kelce-warned-travis-about-engagement-rumors-on-the-podcast>Jason Kelce Warned Travis About Engagement Rumors On The Podcast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-kisses-travis-kelce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jason Kelce encouraged Saquon Barkley to manifest things in "New Heights", he also warned Travis when, a week ago, he made a comment that fueled rumors that he was about to propose to Taylor Swift.</p><p>They were talking about NBA star Victor Wembanyama, who is over 7 feet tall, and the Chiefs star said "You can't tell me that dude wasn't made in a f**king lab over there in France." Jason nodded along, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then Travis added</a><strong>"Lab-grown diamonds, that’s a lab-grown f**king NBA player. Can't wait til I f**kin’ make one,</strong>" and the older brother groaned.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:19</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-s-relationship-with-travis-kelce-is-drastically-different-from-her-past-famous-romances-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances">Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There are a lot of unique things about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's fascinating relationship.</p><p><strong>Jason immediately realized what fans would think when hearing that he's looking forward to getting a diamond for himself, and begged Travis "Don’t do this.
