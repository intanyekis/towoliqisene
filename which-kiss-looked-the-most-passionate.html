Especially today. She actually looked very loving and passionate towads him. Maybe there is hope for SHACK.At first Jack looked lost after the first kiss but then he got very serious and passionate as well.

I was expecting something like their first kiss, but Sharon looked like ahh what are you doing, i dont want to hurt your feelings but no kind of kiss. Didn’t do anything for me, I was hoping if they were gonna kiss(i wish not) it would at least be like the first one ever. And Jack and Sharon, there is just nothing attractive about their kissing. They can look passionate together but their kissing to me isnt. So, I have to say C. because not only are these two extremely beautiful ppl but their kiss looked passionate, hungry for each other <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png title=:slight_smile: alt=:slight_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> , and loving. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png title=:slight_smile: alt=:slight_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> ok, just watched Jack and Sharons kiss on todays show <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png title=:slight_smile: alt=:slight_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I will stick with C. ;)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png title=:slight_smile: alt=:slight_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Quote <strong>aden85</strong>: My honest opinion regardless if I like Shick...I have to say C...because the episode with brad and sharon, ppl were making a huge deal out of and i had to stop and actually watch it and it was nothing to me.
