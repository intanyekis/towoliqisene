He also alleges that an inmate claiming to be an associate of the New York Mafia hit him&nbsp;with a paint roller extension bar, which resulted in injuries to his knee and leg that required surgery. FBI SSA Philip Scalaand dismissed Donaghy’s claims, saying, "If organized crime wanted to hurt Donaghy, he wouldn't be around today."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MLW is reportedly planning a storyline that will have Donaghy serve as a personal referee for Richard Holliday. The personal referee storyline is nothing new. Nick Patrick was the official referee for NWO in 1996. After he was caught cheating, he was forced into a match against <a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> at the World War 3 PPV. Even though Jericho had one arm tied behind his back, he still defeated Patrick.</p><p>"Pro wrestling is entertainment, and I always joked the NBA was a form of entertainment and I compared it a little bit to pro wrestling behind the scenes. When I was growing up, I always enjoyed pro wrestling, guys like <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> and Ivan Putski. I thought it would be fun to get involved and see where it goes," Donaghy told Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MLW, which airs on beIN Sports, Fubo Sports Network and DAZN, has been on hiatus for the past several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The promotion’s roster mainly includes independent contractors from Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide and Impact Wrestling. On August 31, MLW CEO Court Bauer confirmed that the promotion, which is based in New Rochelle, New York, will return to television in early November.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Game 1 Of 2020 NBA Finals On ABC Drew 7.4 Million Viewers, Down Significantly From 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaeSl7amv46doKyfopawprCMnq9mppKWerOxxWaroqVdmbyvrcahsGaln6uytHnOp2Stp12lv7B51qucrKycnruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-matt-rhule-ranks-among-highest-paid-nfl-coaches.html><span>←</span><span>Updated Look At The Highest Paid Head Coaches In The NFL</span></a>
