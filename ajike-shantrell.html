They found Owens with gunshot wounds, which she succumbed to later at the hospital. Sheriff Woods revealed that there was a long-standing feud between Owens and her unnamed neighbor, who has yet to be identified. However, the details surrounding the feud are still undisclosed.</span></p><p>What we do know, however, is that the neighbor, who claimed the shooting was self-defense under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground law,” has not been arrested or charged with a crime. This law allows individuals to use deadly force without any duty to retreat when they feel threatened with death or serious bodily harm in situations outside their homes.</p><p>Many people have criticized the law as being a license to kill and a loophole that allows people to get away with murder. However, others argue that it is necessary to provide individuals with the right to defend themselves in life-threatening situations.</p><p>The shooting of Owens, a beloved member of the community and a mother of three, has left many heartbroken. Her family and friends have expressed their frustration with the situation, with many calling for justice.</p><p>Watch Video: <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.wesh.com/article/ajike-aj-owens-florida/44099384&ved=2ahUKEwj5qazD1a7_AhU9D1kFHYPeDqwQo7QBegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Xt7QQgIoj0DDJfzXKojwA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Here</a><br></p><p>The tragic shooting of Ajike Shantrell Owens has brought up several important topics for discussion.
