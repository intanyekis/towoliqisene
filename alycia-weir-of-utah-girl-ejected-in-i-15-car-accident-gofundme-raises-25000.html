Alycia, known for her spunky and joyful personality, suffered life-threatening injuries when she was ejected from her vehicle during the accident that occurred on Monday.</p><p>According to Utah state troopers, the collision unfolded when a northbound Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, towing a utility trailer, struck the rear of a black Suzuki SUV. Sgt. Cam Roden of the Utah Highway Patrol revealed that the SUV had either stopped or slowed down due to backed-up traffic before the collision occurred. The impact from the truck was concentrated on the back driver’s side of the SUV.</p><p>The force of the collision caused the SUV to veer to the right, flip over, and roll down an embankment off the right shoulder of the road before coming to a stop on its wheels. Tragically, Alycia Weir was thrown from the SUV and sustained life-threatening injuries. She was immediately transported to a medical facility but, sadly, succumbed to her injuries.</p><p>Alycia’s loved ones are devastated by her untimely passing. She was described as a selfless young woman who brought joy and talent into the lives of those around her. Her family, including her parents and brothers, held her in high regard, and she was cherished not only within her family but also by her extended community.</p><p>In response to this tragic loss, Tami Leavitt Anderson has created a <a href=# rel=noopener>GoFundMe</a> page to support Alycia’s family, who have consistently provided love and service to their community. The family and friends of Alycia express gratitude knowing that she will continue to live on through organ donation, a testament to her selflessness in life. The medical expenses resulting from this accident are expected to be substantial, and the GoFundMe campaign aims to alleviate the financial burden on the grieving family.</p><p>The Utah Department of Transportation temporarily closed the right three lanes of northbound Interstate 15 around 8:13 a.m. to manage the aftermath of the accident, with the expectation that all lanes would fully reopen around 11:30 a.m. today.</p><p>The community is united in offering condolences to Alycia Weir’s family and friends during this difficult time. Her memory will live on as a source of inspiration and love to those who were fortunate to have known her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51krq3FwqKYZq%2BVnr9uu8VmrK2ZmGK0qr7LZpyjnZOpsqV5yKdkomVhanqkrdFmmJybmZmyr8CMoKafrZ6ZuqZ50ZqgrJ2jYn92fI9pZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patty-turner.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Patty Turner dating?
