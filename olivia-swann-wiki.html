She is an English actress best known for playing the villain Astra Logue in the popular DC television series Legends of Tomorrow.</p><p>As a result of a botched exorcism performed by another character named John Constantine, Astra’s journey in the show was nothing short of enthralling. She was a child when this happened, but when she became a lady, she worked hard to become one of the most formidable demons in hell. She chose to side with good in a titanic conflict between good and evil, and she soon resumed her usual life at Constantine’s home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2a8cd664-90f3-4bd3-998e-ce48c944d77c.jpg><p>When asked how it felt to play a role with such a compelling and tragic past in an earlier interview with The Nerds of Colour, she replied that she felt fortunate to have been able to bring the character to life.</p><p><strong>“I think it’s phenomenal. Honestly, I feel so lucky and so wonderfully privileged to bring her to life. She’s so detailed and she has so much depth to her, and so much that I’m excited to discover. With, like you said, her backstory and the depth that she has, I think comes a sense of wanting to honor every kind of crack, every part of her that is so nuanced and so flawed, in a way,” Olivia Swann said.</strong></p><p>She continued by saying it was “incredible to play someone like that.”</p><p><strong>“And kind of find different levels within that and just the nuances, which I think is one of those wonderful things as an actor, that you get to kind of play with and delve into and develop. It’s incredible to play someone like that and really get into the mind and personality of them. And its a personality that is quite different to mine so it’s always really fun to find those elements,” she continued.</strong></p><p>Olivia Swann also played Karinna Hailes in a Doctors episode in the movie The River Wild. As NCIS Special Agent Michelle Mackey in NCIS: Sydney, she will play the major character.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_do_we_currently_know_about_NCIS_Sydney></span><strong>What do we currently know about NCIS: Sydney?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The official synopsis of&nbsp;NCIS: Sydney&nbsp;reads,</p><p><strong>“The brilliant and eclectic team of U.S. NCIS Agents and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as they are grafted into a multi-national taskforce to keep naval crimes in check in the most contested patch of ocean on the planet.”</strong></p><p>Olivia Swann will play NCIS Special Agent Michelle Mackey, and Todd Lasance will play her AFP comrade Sergeant Jim “JD” Dempsey in NCIS: Sydney.
