Vanna’s children will definitely be a part of the ceremony, the insider added.</p><p>"Vanna wants to show her appreciation for this wonderful guy who's been so patient,” they continued.

During their marriage, they welcomed two children into the world: daughter Gigi, 27, and son Nikko, 29.

Lat fall, the 67-year old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told PEOPLE she didn’t feel like</a> she needed to get married considering how long she and her beau have been together.</p><p>"I mean, we've been together 12 years, and I feel like we are married," she said. "Do we have to get married? No, because we feel comfortable in our relationship. You know what I mean? I know that he's the one. He knows I'm the one."</p><p>"We don't really talk about it, but you never know," she continued. "I mean, I guess we could, but in my eyes and his eyes, we are married."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vanna’s change of heart may have been motivated by her experience <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">renegotiating her Wheel of Fortune salary</a> for an undisclosed amount in the millions. After Ryan Seacrest was announced as Pat Sajak’s replacement, it was revealed he was being offered a much higher salary than Vanna was currently getting, despite being with the show for two decades. In fact, reports said she hadn’t seen a pay increase in over a decade, despite Sajak’s finishing salary being much higher.</p><p>Vanna quickly lawyered up, but she was able to renegotiate with the network and is staying on with Wheel of Fortune for the foreseeable future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitmqaelnq4tMitnGaonJa7sHnMmqmrsV2XvLqy0aKcp5xdlrO1sdFmrqGdlaF6sLKMn6arrKWjsm68wLJkoqaTp7Kiv8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noah-cyrus-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Noah Cyrus Net Worth How Much is Cyrus Worth?</span></a>
