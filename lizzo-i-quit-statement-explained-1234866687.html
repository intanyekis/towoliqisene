However, this was not the case and the “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=666799>Truth Hurts</a>” singer has since clarified what she meant.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a video she shared on Tuesday (April 2), Lizzo explained, “I just need to clarify — when I say I quit, I mean, I quit giving any <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234738843>negative energy</a> attention. What I’m not gonna quit is the joy of my life, which is making music, which is connecting with people.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She continued, “I know I’m <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234731638>not alone</a>. In no way, shape or form am I the only person who is experiencing that negative voice that seems to be louder than the positive […] I’m going to keep moving forward, I’m going to keep being me. I want to say thank you for the love that I’ve received. It means more than you know.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In her initial message about being sick and tired of being sick and tired, Lizzo expressed, “I’m getting tired of putting up with being dragged by everyone in my life and on the Internet. All I want is to make music and make people happy and help the world be a little better than how I found it. But I’m starting to feel like the world doesn’t want me in it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She opened up about how she’s routinely being ridiculed over “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234779703>lies being told</a> about me for clout & views,” and winds up being “the<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234748555> butt of the joke</a> every single time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234692844>Emmy winner </a>confessed that that wasn’t what she’d signed up for.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She has faced a brunt of public scrutiny in recent months, particularly after three of her former dancers filed a&nbsp;<a href=#>harassment lawsuit</a>, accusing Lizzo of sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, and hostile work conditions.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lizzo has denied such claims, labeling them “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234777570>sensationalized stories</a>,” but attorney Ron Zambrano—who’s repping the dancers—felt her recent post was an “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234866264>outburst seeking attention</a>.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A spokesperson repping Lizzo felt Zambrano’s response was one of many “wild personal attacks that have absolutely nothing to do with the clients who he is supposedly representing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2u8bOZqBmqaWewW6%2F05qrnqWVo8Fusdepo5qhnpqxbn2RbGtxbmZrhXh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./linzey-rozon-10-facts-about-the-wife-of-popular-actor-tim-rozon-number-7-is-fascinating.html><span>←</span><span>Linzey Rozon: 10 facts about the wife of popular actor, Tim Rozon!
