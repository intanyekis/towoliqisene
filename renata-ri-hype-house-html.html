Then, Petrou hinted about a new Hype House member&nbsp;who could be "coming soon."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Thomas Petrou Backs Renata Ri</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Hype House member and co-founder Petrou has recently voiced his opinion in support of the controversial Russian internet personality facing cancel culture. Petrou posted a rant on his&nbsp;YouTube account&nbsp;expressing&nbsp;his opinion regarding the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>In the light of the controversy, Petrou backed his new friend and said that "people don't even understand anything," and called Renata Ri to be "super nice."</p><p>In the now-deleted video clip, Petrou told his&nbsp;audience that he had educated Renata Ri regarding appropriate actions and things to avoid during her time in the&nbsp;United States. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Petrou said that while some of her actions might be appropriate or go unnoticed in Russia, the same cannot be said of the United States. The YouTuber shared his understanding of the matter and spoke in favor of Renata Ri. In his new friend's defense, the content creator said,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I think people forget that there are other places in the world, because they are so used to media and online, and they are so used to California and United States,&nbsp;and all the things that we have here in America.</p><p>Furthermore, Petrou opined how "they forget that there are so many places in this world" where actions similar to Renata Ri aren't looked down upon as they are done in the United States.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, he also discussed the matter of cultural appropriation with Renata Ri and called her past actions "not okay." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Additionally, Petrou claims that he has clarified&nbsp;Renata Ri about "why you can't wear certain things," and "why it is inappropriate to do certain things"&nbsp;in the United States.</p><p>He further informed&nbsp;Renata Ri that one's inappropriate actions "could offend other people," and "hurt other people." Finally, the Youtuber ended the vlog by stating that people should not consider the whole world the same and called such people out as "crazy."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>What Happened with Renata Ri?</h2><p>The internet personality caught the attention of a wider audience after her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">controversial interview</a>. While Renata Ri's interview was originally in Russian, the drama gained mileage when video clips with English translation&nbsp;took rounds on the internet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Renata Ri received criticism and became the subject of online gossip after she&nbsp;used <a href=# rel=follow>racist remarks</a>&nbsp;during her&nbsp;interview. Additionally, she was also criticized for cultural appropriation after her images of wearing&nbsp;inappropriate cultural outfits went viral on the internet.</p><p>Renata Ri later&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>apologized</a> for her actions on TikTok. However, the model is still&nbsp;canceled by online users in light of her controversy. In addition, Renata Ri was also called for her antics involving TikTok's famous influencer, <a href=# rel=follow>Vinnie Hacker</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqVo661rYyroGagqaWybrTOrqqeZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pedro-pascal-sarah-paulson-friendship-early-career-facts.html><span>←</span><span>How Sarah Paulson Once Kept A Struggling Pedro Pascal 'Alive'</span></a>
