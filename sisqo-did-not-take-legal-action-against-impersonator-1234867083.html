After all, the person was unable to travel, complete the performance, or get paid.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It kind of looked like a melted Sisqó, but I could, I could sue,’ explained the <a href=#>“Thong Song” creator</a>. “Once I found out that it was like, some kid from Baltimore, I just dropped it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1392284155.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#>The Dru Hill member</a> spoke to the tabloid after his elimination on Wednesday (April 3) from <a href=#>The Masked Singer.</a> He remained a contender through the current 11th season until the series’ group three finals.

He continued to elaborate that he joked with his family, “I didn’t get the call. It’s [been] 20 years.
