I have a confession to make: I’m an absolute shopaholic when it comes to shoes… and more specifically, Dolce Vita shoes. It’s rare to find a brand which consistently comes out with cute designs that don’t hurt my feet, yet Dolce Vita seems to be the winner. From sandals, to boots, to heels and even sneakers, I have maybe six pairs from the brand."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It’s rare to find a brand which consistently comes out with cute designs that don’t hurt my feet, yet Dolce Vita seems to be the winner. From sandals, to boots, to heels and even sneakers, I have maybe six pairs from the brand.</p><p>Do I need any more? Probably not, but I just discovered that Dolce Vita is having a sneaky sale at Nordstrom. I can’t help myself, but a sale this good — many styles are up to 60% off — can’t be ignored, so I’ll be stocking up while I can. There’s no telling how long the sale will go on!</p><p>There are plenty of shoes to add to cart, but I’m sharing the ones that I absolutely can’t live without below. Happy shopping!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>I’ve never really been a fan of the western styles (they remind me of my small hometown), although Dolce Vita’s design makes them feel a bit more city-chic with the super tall shaft, suede finish and higher block heel. The only issue is I’m having a tough time choosing between Taupe or Onyx!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BootRep.jpg><p>A solid pair of suede boots are a necessity in every winter and fall wardrobe, and these are about to be my new go-tos. I love the rich taupe color and the ’70s-esque design. Plus, I’ve found that Dolce Vita’s heeled boots are some of the most comfortable to walk in. You’ll be able to stomp around for hours in these bad boys!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Another western boot option that doesn’t look too country, these two-toned ankle boots feature an intricate western-inspired design, sleek pointed toe and a slight block heel. Beyond the style, what really sold me on these was the reviews: “The leather is super soft and feels like great quality. The heel height is nice for everyday wear. I was surprised at how much I like these as I’m not really into cowboy boots,” one happy shopper says.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>I do a lot of walking, so I blow through white sneakers quicker than I’d like to admit. In the past, I’ve gone for flat styles, although I’m smitten with the chunky sole on these Dolce Vita sneakers. I love that these look professional enough to wear to the office, but are still casual enough to wear out and about with friends. I have a feeling these will quickly become my most-worn shoes… and I’m sure they will for you too!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOnaalm5Viw6rAwGaqmqSVYruwvsOsq6unnWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-shows-off-bikini-body-shares-july-4th-party-pictures-201367.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Bikini Body: Singer Shares 4th of July Party Pictures</span></a>
