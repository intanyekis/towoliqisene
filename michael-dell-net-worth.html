He dropped out of college and abandoned his medical degree to start a computer repair business which eventually grew into the publicly traded company Dell, Inc. Dell generates over $90 billion in revenue annually and Michael still serves as CEO and Chairman.</p><p>However, Michael’s net worth is not solely tied to Dell Technologies. He owns approximately 50% of the company, but much of his wealth comes from his closely-held investment company, MSD Capital. MSD Capital manages $16 billion in assets, $12 billion of which comes from Michael’s own personal fortune. MSD Capital owns interests in real estate, private equity, stocks, bonds, and more.</p><h2><span id=Early_Years_and_Passion_for_Business>Early Years and Passion for Business</span></h2><p>Michael Saul Dell was born in Houston, Texas in 1965 and displayed a passion for business from a very young age. He took a high school equivalency exam at the age of eight and enjoyed investing in stocks and precious metals during his teenage years. Dell’s early experiences with computers included purchasing a calculator at the age of seven and disassembling his first computer, an Apple II, at the age of 15. Despite his love for business and technology, Dell’s parents wanted him to become a doctor, and he agreed to enter pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983.</p><p>During his time in college, Dell continued to pursue his entrepreneurial interests and earned $200,000 per year by selling subscriptions to the “Houston Post.” Eventually, he dropped out of college at the age of 19 to focus on his career in business.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Dells_Rise_to_Success>Michael Dell’s Rise to Success</span></h2><p>Michael Dell started selling upgrade kits for personal computers while in college and registered his company as “PC’s Limited” in 1984. He incorporated the company as “Dell Computer Corporation” after strong sales and relocated the business to Austin with a budget of $1000 and a few employees.</p><p>By 1992, Michael Dell became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in the top 500 corporations with Dell reporting $1 million in sales per day. In 1998, he established MSD Capital L.P. to manage his assets and in 2001, the company became the world’s largest PC maker.</p><p>Michael stepped down as the Chairman of Dell, Inc. in 2004, but remained the CEO.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Dells_Real_Estate_Investments>Michael Dell’s Real Estate Investments</span></h2><p>Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies, has invested a significant portion of his wealth in real estate. In 2014, he acquired New York’s most expensive home, a penthouse on Billionaire’s Row for just over $100 million. The six-bedroom property spans just under 11,000 square feet and occupies the entirety of the 89th and 90th floors on the One57 building in Midtown.</p><p>In 2017, Dell purchased a penthouse in Boston for $40 million, located in the Four Seasons Private Residences building on Dalton Street. He also owns a property in Los Cabos, Mexico, worth $18.5 million, which is solely for investment purposes.</p><p>Back in 1996, Dell constructed a 33,000-square-foot home in Austin for his family. The property features 8 bedrooms, a home gym, and an indoor lap pool. The Dell family also owns several lots adjacent to the property, which means that the total compound spans about 120 acres. Dell’s 6D Ranch, located 12 miles from his Austin home, is dedicated to a number of Arabian horses.</p><p>After purchasing the Four Seasons Maui in 2004, Dell set up shop on the Big Island of Hawaii’s Kohala coast with the purchase of another stunning residence in the exclusive community of Kukio. The home and its neighborhood are completely off-limits to anyone who isn’t a homeowner. Dell’s home in Kukio is the largest in the entire neighborhood, with a square footage of 18,500 square feet and seven bedrooms.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Dells_Business_Ventures>Michael Dell’s Business Ventures</span></h2><p>Michael Dell is the sole owner of MSD Capital and owns 65% of MSD Partners, which manages over $16 billion in assets. In 2003, Dell Inc. was taken private for $25 billion and then taken public again in 2018, with Michael owning 50% of the company’s outstanding shares. He also purchased EMC Corp. for $67 billion in 2015, forming Dell Technologies, the largest private technology company in the world which generates over $90 billion in revenue annually.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC5yJyfmp2cYrGmuMtmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-dillon-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Dillon Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
