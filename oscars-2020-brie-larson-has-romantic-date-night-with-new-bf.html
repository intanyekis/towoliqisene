Six months earlier, Larson <a href=#>called off her engagement</a> to Greenwald, 40, who popped the question during a trip to Tokyo in March 2016.</p><p>Larson previously <a href=#>raved</a> about her ex-fiancé while speaking to USA Today in August 2017.</p><p>“I don’t think I could do any of this without my person,” she said about Greenwald at the time. “It’s a safe place to be unsafe. I can go out in the world and I can take risks and I can push myself to the limit, and then there’s that core that knows me and no matter how far I go, I’m still the same when I come back. That’s a really valuable thing.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One year earlier, the musician received a sweet shout-out from Larson as she accepted the <a href=#>Academy Award</a> for Best Lead Actress for her work in Room.</p><p>“Alex Greenwald, I love you,” she said in her 2016 speech.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKasm5GnwG5%2Bj2tnZpqinrJuuMCrqqimXZ2utHnRqKSapqSesG6wwK2cZqaZnLW1edaiq6FlnprEbq7FaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miley-cyrus-marilyn-monroe-blonde-hair-fishnet-stockings-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Miley Cyrus Rocks Marilyn Monroe Blonde Hair &amp;amp; Fishnet Stockings: Pics Hollywood Life</span></a>
