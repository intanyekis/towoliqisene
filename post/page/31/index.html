Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain’t no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)
I ain’t got a fever got a permanent disease
And it’ll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn’t what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Girlfriend, Ethnicity, Age, Height, Net Worth And All You Need To Learn</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>
