Hamlin was rocking a $3,150 Takashi Murakami "Travis Jesus" jacket to the Super Bowl 2023 and sat near NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Sunday, February 12. The jacket said, “Without the end or beginning there is no day and there is no night.” Additionally, the back of the jacket featured an offensive image of a crucifix with an altered head of Jesus which in turn created a buzz among fans. Peterson was having none of it and called the outfit "Blasphemy".</p><p>Peterson believed that Hamlin, who had a <a href=# rel>highly public heart attack</a> while playing against the Bengals in Week 17, was disrespecting God by wearing the jacket. “You should be thanking God son!” Peterson wrote a caption on Instagram. “This is Blasphemy!! We all fall short but cmon man! I find this disrespectful!! #grateful #goddid.” Peterson, who played running back in the NFL from 2007 to 2011, is the fifth-leading rusher in league history, <a href=# rel>RadarOnline</a> reported.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'I'm doing great': Damar Hamlin aims to return to NFL after suffering on-field cardiac arrest</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Denny Kellington? Damar Hamlin says he 'literally owes his life' to Buffalo Bills trainer</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Takashi Murakami?</h2><p>The "Travis Jesus" jacket worn by Damar Hamlin was designed by contemporary Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, 62, who was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. He works in both, the fine arts, and business media.</p><p>Murakami is renowned for blurring the lines between high and low arts as well as the co-aesthetic aspects of the Japanese creative legacy and the postwar nature of Japanese culture and society. He serves as an inspiration for other Japanese artists. He is the founder and President of Kaikai Kiki Co. Ltd. which manages several young artists under his direction.</p><h2 class=split>AD could have handled the situation more privately</h2><p>Strangely enough, not everyone concurs with the future <a href=# rel>Hall of Famer</a>, including former All-Pro running back Fred Taylor, who thinks Peterson could have handled the situation more privately than writing a public post. "You should DM him bro…I’m sure he’s listen to your opinion. Posting it doesn’t help anyone. He’s young, young ppl don’t always think before they wear things just like people who wear skulls and other things that doesn’t align with Christian beliefs. Try to reach him," Taylor wrote to Peterson. But, Adrian, a devoted Christian, was still having none of it. "But this was different! I know young people don’t think at times, older as well! But with everything surrounding his situation!! This isn’t one of those moments where it’s a young guy not thinking!" Peterson wrote back to Taylor.</p><h2 class=split>I spoke to Damar Hamlin&nbsp;</h2><p>Adrian Peterson shared an Instagram post on February 13 claiming he spoke with Damar Hamlin about the "disrespectful" jacket he wore to the Super Bowl. Although, Peterson claims he still despises the jacket, he doesn't think the 24-year-old was speaking with hatred. The post caption read, "So I spoke with [Damar], and we were able to discuss our thoughts as men. I want to be clear, I’m the last person to judge anyone, and that was never my intention," Adrian wrote. "However, I do feel as if the jacket was disrespectful and it was something that I needed to share. I do realize everyone makes mistakes and falls short at times, so again, my intention was never to judge, just to share my opinion."</p><p>Adrian then sent a direct message to Hamlin, stating "Damar, I have respect and love for you and I wish you nothing but the best, but I just can’t rock with that jacket. I feel like there are a lot of people, young and old, looking up to you and with power and influence comes great responsibility. I apologize for offending you." Peterson proceeded and eventually concluded his speech with a kind of peace offering, saying "After speaking with Damar, I have an understanding that it didn’t come from a place of ill intent! #grateful #god #forgiveness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqWx0qKep52UYrGiucCrZKGZnaG2r7%2BMrKypnaJir7DDy2ahmpubmsFurcOroJqmXaWytbHRrKanZaOhrq6%2FjKisrZ6ZqXqivM%2BemKuhnpx6tbuMpqaco12fsrTB0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-harry-reached-out-to-prince-william-after-kate-cancer-diagnosis.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Harry Reached Out to Prince William After Kate Cancer Diagnosis</span></a>
