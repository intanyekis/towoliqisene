During the first decade of her career, the only movies she got cast in were made for teenagers. She was never really in any adult movies — until now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Megan Fox's Life Dramatically Changed After Her Divorce</a></span></p><p>She's finally beginning her adult career and she started it off with an awesome thriller that is already catching a lot of people's attention. This year, she starred in the horror movie Till Death, which is about a woman who gets handcuffed to her dead husband in his twisted plan for revenge. It's nothing like Megan Fox has ever done before. Let's take a look at how Till Death is different than all of her other movies.</p><h2 id=lsquo-till-death-rsquo-is-nothing-like-lsquo-jennifer-rsquo-s-body-rsquo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>‘Till Death’ Is Nothing Like ‘Jennifer’s Body’</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Jennifer’s Body</a> is the movie Megan Fox is most known for and helped her become as famous as she is today. She has a few popular movies, but that’s the only one with a cult following and one of the only horror movies she’s ever been in. Till Death is only her second horror movie. Although Till Death is gory like Jennifer’s Body, they are still two completely different movies. Megan told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, "It was just different than anything else I had read or seen. I haven't done, like, a marriage drama before. I haven't done, like, a grownup movie. I haven't done a traditional thriller or horror movie before. Because Jennifer's Body was not that. It was very much, like, a teen, angsty, dark comedy. And this is not."</p><h2 id=it-deals-with-more-serious-topics><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>It Deals With More Serious Topics</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer’s Body deals with some serious topics like murder, but most of the story is about teenagers in high school. When you watch it, it pretty much brings you back to high school, but with the exception of a demonic teenager who eats guys. Till Death is completely different than that. It does have murder in it too, but the story has more serious themes in it such as cheating, mental health, suicide, and marriage. The movie is made more for an older audience, especially anyone who’s married. Anyone who watches it learns the message to leave instead of cheat. Jennifer’s Body didn’t really have that much of a message at the end — except don’t trust shady people in creepy vans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Are All Of Megan Fox's Tattoos And What Do They Mean?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-had-to-use-all-of-her-strength-to-pull-off-her-role><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Megan Had To Use All Of Her Strength To Pull Off Her Role</strong></span></h2><p>The Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series had some big stunts, but that was barely anything compared to Till Death. Megan didn’t have to make crazy jumps or anything like that, but she still had to use all of her strength to portray a woman chained to her dead husband. She told Yahoo, “I’ve done a lot of physical films, a lot of stunt-heavy films, a lot of films with explosives and things like that, but I haven’t ever just bore the weight of an actual human body, like a grown man that I carried around all day, every day, which I did do on this. At first, I was like, ‘This is easy, it’s a great hamstring workout, I’m going to get through it, it’s not going to be a problem.’ But then by the end, I was exhausted. I didn’t realize how tired I was at the end. I was wrecked after this.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-rsquo-s-nothing-funny-in-it-like-in-some-of-her-other-movies><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>There’s Nothing Funny In It Like In Some Of Her Other Movies</strong></span></h2><p>Megan Fox has mostly been in action and drama movies, but she’s been in a few comedy movies too. Besides Jennifer’s Body, she has been in Think Like a Dog, The Dictator, This Is 40, and Friends With Kids. She definitely has a talent for being able to portray a wide range of characters. But you don’t get to see any of her comedy skills in Till Death. Since the plot of the movie is so serious and dangerous, there aren’t any funny scenes in it. Unlike some of Megan’s other films, you probably won’t even giggle when you watch it. You’ll be on the edge of your seat the whole time waiting to see what’s going to happen next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-has-come-a-long-way-since-lsquo-confessions-of-a-teenage-drama-queen-rsquo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Megan Has Come A Long Way Since ‘Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen’</strong></span></h2><p>Before Megan started doing more serious roles and began her adult acting career, she starred in a lot of teen movies. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, she said, “When I was a teenager, all those little movies I was doing with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen [Holiday in the Sun], and then Lindsay Lohan [Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen] and Kaley Cuoco [Crimes of Fashion], that was essentially the exact same character. All of my lines were interchangeable.” Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen was her first popular movie and led to the rest of the movies that made her famous. Most of her roles in the teen movies were pretty much the same—a pretty and popular high school girl. Till Death shows that she is capable of much more than that. She was able to dive deep into her character, Emma, and portray her as someone fans would want to root for even though she cheated on her husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Megan Fox And Lindsay Lohan's 'Rivalry'</a></span></p><h2 id=she-rsquo-s-showing-the-world-how-strong-women-are><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>She’s Showing The World How Strong Women Are</strong></span></h2><p>Those teen movies she did might have helped her become famous, but they also gave people the wrong idea about her since she kept getting cast as the same character for a while. She told The Washington Post, “I think there has been a pervasive perception of me as a shallow succubus, if that makes any sense, for at least the first decade of my career. And then that started to change more recently as people revisited some of my interviews, listened to me speak and started to see me in a different way.” Not only does Till Death show people what she’s capable of, the movie also shows them how strong women are. Her character, Emma, had to think of every way possible to survive the brutal winter while barely having any clothes on and being chained to a dead body. And she had to survive two attackers who showed up at her house on top of it. By taking on roles like this, Megan Fox is now showing women that they are so much more than just their looks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Things Megan Fox Has Shared About Her New Movie, 'Till Death'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqbatuIydnJqsmGKxqrLFnqmepqRiuqazwKdkn6eoYry1tMSrZKanpp6ytHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guiding-belief-crossword-clue-nyt-99920944.html><span>←</span><span>Guiding belief Crossword Clue NYT</span></a>
