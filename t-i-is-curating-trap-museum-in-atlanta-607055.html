Just 15 years ago, Tip released 2003’s Trap Muzik&nbsp;via Atlantic Records.</p><p>When he created Trap Muzik,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_t-i_1 data-tag=t-i>T.I.</a> knew he wanted to make something that was going to influence many for years to come. “I wanted to make a classic. I knew I had to make timeless music, which could stand the test of time,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Noisey</a>. “It was about showing that even if you were participating in felonious activities, there were still other things you needed to deal with: you’re not just drug dealing but also dealing with a relationship with your parents, your girlfriend, having a child too young and being looked down on by society as one thing, when you’re actually much more than that definition,” he added.</p><p>“You might have had a homeboy who just died, but he wasn’t even in the streets like that!&nbsp;<i>Trap Muzik</i>&nbsp;was kind of crystallizing this black experience into a piece of music,” he continued.</p><p>The exhibit is also in partnership with veteran hip hop journalist Maurice Garland and creative artist DL Warfield, among others. In efforts to highlight the genre’s influence throughout the years,&nbsp; T.I.&nbsp;will feature a slew of memorable moments and artists who helped bring the genre at the forefront of pop culture. Such artists include the likes of&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Future</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Savage</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2Chainz, </a>Gucci Mane, Rick Ross, Young Jezzy, and more.</p><p>In addition to art work, the museum will also feature an “Escape the Trap” room where guests will get clues and crack codes to help them come out of the installation. The Trap Music Muzik Museum will be open to the public on September 30th from 2:00pm to 8:00pm&nbsp; at 630 Travis Street NW, Atlanta, GA.
