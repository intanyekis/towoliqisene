Love Island is a <a href=#>reality show</a> based on the theme of love and coupling. However, all the <a href=#>couples formed</a> as part of this show are not necessarily romantic partners. Since it is mandatory to form a pair with another contestant on the show, the couples are either based on romantic compatibility or survival.</p><p>The contestants must live in a villa called an Island, in the sense that they have to remain isolated from the rest of the world as long as they are on the show. Participants may either get eliminated if they fail to form a couple with another contender or if the viewers vote them out. The audience can vote someone out by voting against them through the Love Island app.</p><p>It might sound complicated, but this reality show has been quite popular throughout the UK, where it originated, before being imported by the US and Australia. This reality show has had such good reach that some of its contestants have emerged as millionaires after production ended. The grand prize for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winning couple is $100,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following is a list of Love Island Stars that made millions after the show.</p><h2 id=the-couple-alex-bowman-and-olivia-buckland>The Couple Alex Bowman and Olivia Buckland</h2><p>Alex Bowman and Olivia Buckland are perhaps two of the most <a href=#>popular contestants</a> to appear on the reality show.

He is known for a television role with Olivia Atwood. Later they split, and then he made another show with his best friend, Kem Cetinay (and fellow name on the list).</p><p>Hughes has also <a href=#>endorsed brands and MNCs like McDonald's</a> and Carphone Warehouse to make his millions.
