In an&nbsp;IG picture of his newborn son, the Temptation actor noted that his&nbsp;baby’s “color is comin’ in nicely!” I’m hyped!”</p><p>From that point, Gross’ comments section became flooded with&nbsp;social media users that saw nothing wrong with the 37-year-old’s caption while others questioned why color needed to be mentioned.&nbsp;Following the outpour of opinions, Gross <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">addressed</a> the backlash in a lengthy statement. He also has a three-year-old daughter.</p><p>“Two things I’m proud of is the ability to smile through any situation and the rich melanin that layers my body! For my daughter or son to share that blessing makes me overjoyed,” he said. “Miss me with the self-hate cause those opinions and assumptions are invalid. I love me more than anyone else ever could I won’t argue with fools but I’m down to inform the misinformed to a certain extent before I stop giving a sh*t.”</p><p>Gross added that while he doesn’t want to dwell on this topic any longer, he believes its grip on black communities is getting tighter and tighter. “Colorism exists, yes but y’all not about to just label every dark skin Black man who is in a relationship with someone lighter complexion under that bus,” he continued. “I chose love,&nbsp;not skin tone.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Gross has publicized his view of colorism. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016</a>, he and a group of friends posed for a Christmas-themed photo. Viewers noticed that the men in the photo were attached to light-skinned women while a dark-skinned woman was seen by herself. Gross swiftly cleared the air and said “we’ve been doing the same joke for years,” and proceeded to show evidence of this “inside joke.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lance Gross Marries Rebecca Jefferson In Los Angeles</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Gur6%2FEZp6rp6OoeqWt0aRkrKOZo7umsIycpqWnop7ArnmUcnBxaWVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./home-town-stars-ben-erin-napier-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Home Town Stars Ben, Erin Napier: Relationship Timeline</span></a>
