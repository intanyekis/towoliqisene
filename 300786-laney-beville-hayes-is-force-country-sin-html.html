However, tragedy struck their family in recent years following the death of what would have been their seventh child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/86032664452362cbc7beda09ec6453d3.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Walker Hayes and Laney Beville Hayes pose at the 2021 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on November 21, 2021, in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Laney Beville Hayes Met Her Future Husband in High School</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Though their story began in elementary school, they only started talking and had their <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wideopencountry.com/walker-hayes-wife/>first date</a> in high school. Laney was a popular cheerleader, and Walker was too nervous to go up and speak with her.</p><p class=dh>That was until they both participated in a school production called "Little Shop of Horrors." She and Walker did an "Ask Me Anything" session on Instagram in 2020, where they shared a few words about their first interaction, with Laney <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL4a3gYuEhY&t=34s">saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He started singing. I thought it was awesome."</p><p class=dh>Walker then expressed his appreciation for the compliment. For their first date, he recalled visiting a Genie at a construction site during his interview on "The Bobby Bones Show." To commemorate the special night, he drew her a picture, which she took for safekeeping.</p><p class=dh>Afterward, the lovebirds spent hours talking. They dated for seven years before tying the knot on June 12, 2004. About a month before their 15 anniversary, in 2019, Walker posted a 1997 throwback picture of him and Laney <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/BxaGFK4FL_n/>all snuggled up</a> as they smiled at the camera.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Laney Beville Hayes Never Doubted Her Husband's Dreams</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"She's been beside me guys, she's thrown a lot of heartbreaks along this wave and never once did the woman ever say, 'hey you think you want to have a more normal ambition or a more realistic dream.'

Following the song's release in 2019, its lyrics touched the hearts of many and led to an interview on "The Bobby Bones Show," where Laney<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSTIUmFQmUY"> joined her husband</a>. However, it wasn't the first hit song smash hit she inspired.</p><p class=dh>After his win at the CMT awards ceremony, also attended by stars <a class="me a" href=#>Lainey Wilson</a> and Rachel Smith, he released "Face In The Crowd."

The order in which they were born is unknown, but the couple is parents to three boys and three girls. Their names are Lela, Chapel, Baylor, Beckett, Everly, and Loxley.</p><p class=dh>While Laney has been responsible for homeschooling their kids, as they couldn't afford childcare, Walker was more involved in their extracurricular activities. They are also fans of the Tennessee Titans, as they all once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CIeNUEEJ-ZS/>enjoyed a game</a> as a unit in December 2020.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Walker Hayes Nearly Lost Laney Beville Hayes While She Was Delivering Their Seventh Child</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In early 2018, Walker and Laney were excited about the arrival of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/walker-hayes-laney-hayes-baby-girl-death-uterine-rupture/>their seventh baby</a>. However, when the time came for Laney to give birth, things took an unfavorable and dire turn. Though they welcomed another baby girl, whom they named <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkX73nrBQp0/>Oakleigh Klover</a>, she was stillborn.</p><p class=dh>A nurse delivered the tragic news to Walker, but as he panicked about how he would tell Laney, she said his wife might not make it either. Laney had suffered a uterine tear, leading to her baby's passing and her own near death. Fortunately, she survived, but she still had to mourn her youngest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnaW9oa3qtrc2esGaalau2rbjEZp%2BasZWoeqq%2FjJ%2Bmq5uVYrCwwc2tqbJlo567b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kay-adams-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kay Adams Net Worth How Much is Kay Adams Worth?</span></a>
