As of early 2017, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be $500,000 acquired from her years working as a model and actress in both film and television in a career which began in the early 1990s.</p><h3>Donna D’Errico Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Born in Dothan, Alabama, D’Errico wasn’t interested in modelling or acting during her early years. While studying at Pacelli High School in Columbus, Georgia, D’Errico enjoyed studying especially math, and wanted to be an accountant, but upon graduation, D’Errico moved to California and tried her hand in modelling.</p><p>Although she enjoyed being a model and the career also helped her income, D’Errico later on opened a Las Vegas-based limousine company, however, in 1995 her career took a major change when men’s magazine, Playboy, asked her to be in their September 1995 Playmate of the Month. After being featured in Playboy, D’Errico then entered television and became part of the hit television show “Baywatch”; for two years she played the character of Donna Marco and has since appeared not just in the sequel “Baywatch Nights”. Her appearance in the show not only boosted her career but also tremendously helped her net worth.</p><p>D’Errico’s career in movie and television then flourished. Some of the other projects that she has been involved in have included hosting the show “BattleBots” and playing the lead character in the movie “Candyman: Day of the Dead”. She also appeared in other productions such as “Sabrina, the Teenage Witch”, “Austin Power in Goldmember”, “Intervention”, “Reno 911!” and “Celebrity Paranormal Project”. Her various appearances in both movies and on television also helped raise her wealth.</p><p>In terms of her personal life, D’Errico was married to rock star <a href=#>Nikki Sixx</a>, but the two ended their eleven-year marriage in 2007 due to Sixx’s chemical dependence problems. Their divorce also took a toll on D’Errico’s net worth, leading her to file for bankruptcy in 2014. The judge who presided over her bankruptcy case awarded her a monthly spousal support payment and a portion of Sixx’s annual income. D’Errico shares a daughter with Sixx, and also has another son from a previous relationship.</p><p>Today, D’Errico is still active in acting, but aside from her career in Hollywood, D’Errico has also been recognized lately with her devotion to her Roman Catholic faith, making it a mission to climb Turkey’s Mount Ararat to look for the remains of Noah’s Ark, and create a documentary about it. In 2014, she successfully raised enough money to produce the documentary.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.840593141798><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 30, 1968</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Dothan, Alabama, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 5" (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>110 lb (50 kg; 7.9 st)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Model</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Pacelli High School in Columbus, Georgia</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Nikki Sixx (m. 1996–2007)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Frankie-Jean Sixx (Frankie-Jean Mary Feranna), Rhyan D'Errico</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Partner</td><td>Rhyan D'Errico (Rhyan D'Errico's father)</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsDonnaDErrico</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/DonnaDErrico</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/donnaderrico/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27586206896552><td>LinkedIn</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-d-errico-b808a87</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000351</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>"Playmate of the Month" (Playboy, 1995)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Movies</td><td>116 MacDougal (2018), Only God Can (2015), The Making of Plus One (2010), Kiss the Bride (2002), Comic Book: The Movie (2004), Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), Candyman 3: Day of the Dead (1999), Men in White (1998)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>TV Shows</td><td>Roadies (2016), Reno 911!
