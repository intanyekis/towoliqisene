And I was like, ‘I can’t fit five people in,’” Fey, 53, explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly </a>at the time. “I feel like if I could only get one person as a surprise, the original movie is really Lindsay’s movie. As great as they all are, she’s the heart of that movie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lindsay-Lohan-Reunites-With-Mean-Girls-Tim-Meadows-for-New-Christmas-Movie-1.jpg><p>While Fey was trying to think of something for Lohan to do that “you wouldn’t expect,” she eventually landed on having Lohan appear in the third act of the movie as a moderator during the Mathletes competition, which includes Rice’s Cady.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Just to have her do that late in the movie, it also feels like it comes, I hope, at a time where fans weren’t expecting one more little surprise,” Fey shared. “It also lets her be smart, which Cady is.”</p><p>Lohan also showed her support for the new Mean Girls film by <a href=#>attending the premiere</a> on January 8.</p><p>“[Mean Girls] has stood the test of time,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time. “I feel really grateful. I mean, it’s not very often that you have all these movies that do that. Mean Girls really opened the doors for a lot of things going on in schools. I think it’s also a really fun movie, so it’s really a blessing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOippSorrp5y6ifmqZdp7K2usitnKxlp57BqXnMnpinZZeev62%2FjK2gpmWdmq6lu9asZJ%2BnomK7psOMpqavoZVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fact-check-is-lilly-singh-lesbian-sexuality-gender.html><span>←</span><span>Fact Check: Is Lilly Singh Lesbian?
