I've heard it all," the handsome, famously buff star says.</p><p>"See, I don't really go after girls. Most of the girlfriends I've had have come after me. So it's really funny when girls get offended because I don't hit on them," explains Lutz, who has dated 90210's <strong>AnnaLynne McCord</strong> and Step It Up 3D actress <strong>Sharni Vinson.</strong></p><p>"[Girls] will transform their insecurity into, 'Oh, that makes sense, because I heard you're into guys and have a boyfriend.'" he adds of women who assume he's gay. "I'm like, 'Seriously? That's your tactic to get me to like you?' There will always be rumors, but I know who I am."</p><p>Regardless, the hunk is as gay-friendly as can be — and counts his gay male fans among his faves.</p><p>"Oh, they're the best. I love them," he gushes. "When I meet gay fans out and about, they're so great to talk to — and I'm big on hugging, because I'm from the Midwest. They're just so energetic and loving. I'm proud to have those fans, and their support means a lot to me. I don't want just girls coming to my movies; I want guys to come too!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lutz also counts several gay men among his best pals — and he says, "Honestly, I'd prefer to live with gay guys."</p><p>How come? "They're the cleanest, and they just take care of stuff. Because I'm always away, coming home to a clean house means a lot to me. Trust me, I've lived with a lot of roommates, and straight guys are just kids who don't pick up after themselves."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepJyWu2641K2xZp%2BZp7m0edOhoKejXZ66brPAsmSbnZOWwrSxjKJknaeeqXqptdNmpqdlpJ2yrnmRaWhqaWlmfXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./has-taylor-swift-shown-desire-to-get-married.html><span>←</span><span>Has Taylor Swift Shown Any Desire To Get Married?</span></a>
