Sources told <a href=#><i>TMZ</i></a> the unidentified seller has been friends with the legendary folk singer since they were children, and received the lyrics sheet more than two decades ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Desolation Row” came as Dylan was transitioning from traditional folk music to electronic. The song, which serves as <i>Highway 61 Revisited </i>closer, centers on a large cast of characters living in a chaotic and unpleasant place. During a 1965 press conference, Dylan was asked where Desolation Row was located.</p><p>“Where? Oh, that’s some place in Mexico,” he told a TV station. “It’s across the border. It’s noted for its coke factory. Coca-Cola machines … sell a lot of Coca-Cola down there.”</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>: </b></a><a href=#><b>F.
