The G-Unit General said Beanie was so hot at the time, he was willing to drop some big money to get him.</p><p>“It was at least $800,000 at that point. At least, with the heat that was around him at that point,” Fif’ explained. “I’ll tell you what I paid for <strong>Mobb Deep</strong>–that was at least $800,000 at that point. There’s no way [Beanie Sigel] wouldn’t have got that.</p><p>“I thought that [Jay-Z] felt that he would be losing something to me, when they wouldn’t do the deal,” he continued. “I get him out and go right away with the actual music. I was aware of Beans at that point, because I was going to the joint he was in.”</p><p>At press time, it wasn’t clear if the deal was official yet, or if they were still ironing out the details. But one thing is clear, 50 is interested and Beans seems to be as well.</p><p>(<a href=# rel=nofollow>Download audio of the interview here</a> <img decoding=async title="Icon - Audio" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ballerstatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/icon-audio.gif alt="Icon - Audio" width=12 height=8 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>)</p><p>As the interview continued, Beanie went in, responding to <a href=#>Jay-Z’s recent comments</a>, in which he said Sigel was given many opportunities to succeed despite not earning them. During a Canadian press conference, Jay said that Beanie was given a record label, clothing line, and even at one point, was driving two Bentleys–all of this without a platinum plaque under his belt.</p><p>Beanie says those statements are false. He claims that Roc-A-Fella Records co-founder <strong>Kareem “Biggs” Burke</strong> placed the down payments for both vehicles as a birthday gift, his only obligation being a monthly car note of just $5,100.</p><p>“It’s not like I had all this wealth and I bought… like you helped me obtain all this wealth and gave me me these two Bentleys,” Sigel explained. “They just gave away monthly plans. The issue with the Bentleys, you shot yourself in the foot with that.</p><p>“You didn’t give me a record label. It only cost a couple hundred to search the name, <a href=# id=auto-tag_state-property_2 data-tag=state-property>State Property</a> Records. I think I paid another couple hundred dollars and I patented the LLC company. My record label only cost me $700 … maybe $750. I did that on my own. You didn’t give me that,” he continued.</p><p>In fact, Beanie Sigel says the Roc-A-Fella heads didn’t give him much. He did admit that the State Property Clothing line was given to him like Jay stated. However, the deal was in Jay-Z’s favor and not his. In the end, the profits were taken from him anyway.</p><p>“What did you give me? The clothing line that you gave me? I had 20% of State Property Clothing. It was me, Jay, <strong>Dame</strong>, and the two other Russians that had the Rocawear, owned State Property,” Beans explained. “Even on the clothing line … the same reason why you and Dame broke up–Jay-Z–because he was taking all the money from Rocawear and putting it into all his other lil companies. He did the same thing to State Property.”</p><p>Still, despite all the behind-the-scenes scheming, Beans said he was in Jay-Z’s corner. He even went to bat for him in a battle against the <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_ruff-ryders_2 data-tag=ruff-ryders>Ruff Ryders</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_jadakiss_2 data-tag=jadakiss>Jadakiss</a></strong> in the early 2000s. But, according to the rapper, things changed when Jay turned his back on him during his highly publicized weapons trial in 2004. Jay was ordered to take the stand in his trial, and while he did say nice things about the Philly rapper, he didn’t back him when it would’ve helped him most.</p><p>“When he was on the stand, he spoke good things about me–I’m an incredible artist, this and that,” Beanie began. “So, she said, ‘So, if I was to release him today to continue to go on the Roc The Mic Tour together, would you be willing to be responsible for his whereabouts?’ And it was silence… and he said ‘No.’ That’s when my relationship with Jay was tainted. This ain’t a money issue, like ‘No?’… everything you told this lady I was, it meant nothing. Jay was really never down with me.”</p><p>As the interview went on, he revealed several shady behind the scenes incidents that went on during Roc-A-Fella Records’ heyday, and promised to continue his onslaught against Jay-Z until he gets a response out of him.</p><p>“He is a crumb. I’m gonna put my foot on his neck until he responds. Please make a record,” Beanie concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eyorrInmSsoZeauW60xJqbnpxdnHq2usitZG1vZ26FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./claire-coffee-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Claire Coffee Net Worth</span></a>
