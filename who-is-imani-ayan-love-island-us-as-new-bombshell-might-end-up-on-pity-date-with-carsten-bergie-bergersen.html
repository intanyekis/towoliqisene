The episode ended with Anna Kurdys self-eliminating, leaving Carsten "Bergie" Bergersen with no pairing. In order to fill the gap, two new islanders came in to once again shuffle the storyline and the couples' status.</p><p>Episode 14 ended on a cliffhanger, making fans wonder who will the new bombshells go on a date with. The pairing up of new bombshells is in the fans' hands. Peacock uploaded the picture of the new bombshells and captioned it, "Who should our two new Bombshells go on a date with? Head to the #LoveIslandUSA app to VOTE." As we wait for one of the islanders to go on a date with new bombshells, let us take a look at who Imani is.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Why did Zeta Morrison and Timmy Pandolfi split?

She is into beauty and lifestyle. Imani is also a traveler who loves hopping on beaches and different places. In 2020, she decided to follow her dreams and change her passion into a career. Imani "left everything" that gave her comfort and turned her passion for lashing into a full-time business. She launched a brand named Graced by Mani. Imani was preparing for medical school, however, it's not revealed on her social media whether she got into one or not.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Once targeted Welsh footballer Scott van-der Sluis prepares for comeback on spin-off show 'Love Island Games'</a></p><h2 class=split>Imani Ayan is Miss California contestant</h2><p>Imani knows best how to embrace her beauty. She participated in Miss California and was even a part of the Top 10 contestant. Imani wrote in one of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">posts</a>, "For years I‚Äôve volunteered throughout my community by performing at convalescent homes, within food drives, my schools first ever Black Student Union, as a youth volunteer junior coach, toy giveaways, and hands on within my community before even knowing about the @missamerica organization ... all for the love of service."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'Love Island Games': What is Johnny Middlebrooks's net worth?

She called her participation to be her "first-ever competition." She then described her hardships and wrote, "I‚Äôm eager to represent us all on stage as Miss Sacramento County @misssaccounty and with God‚Äôs grace possibly your MISS CALIFORNIA! I took the train everyday throughout the competition with no experience in the ‚Äúpageant‚Äù world but the means to change my community and speak my truth."</p><h2 class=split>Who will Imani Ayan go on a date with?</h2><p>It is up to the viewers to choose who they want Imani to go on a date with. As Bergie is left with no partner in the show, it is speculated that Imani might end up pairing with him.
