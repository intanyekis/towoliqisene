I’ll say, ‘You know what, let me tell you a little story about some of the locker rooms I’ve been in. And some of the places that I’ve been because you and I came up in a very different time.’ This is, without a doubt, the best wrestling locker room I’ve ever been in,” Don Callis said. “Tony Khan is the best wrestling boss I’ve ever had.</p><p>“I prefer not to have a boss, but here’s the great thing about wrestling. When you’re as good as I am at this stuff, you really don’t have a boss. You dictate to the boss; you know how that goes. So it’s such a great environment. And people say oh, it’s nice to have creative freedom.</p><p>“To me, that just means I get to be me, and I get to do whatever I want to do and not get in trouble for it, not get arrested for it, not get locked up in an asylum for it. Because that’s what would’ve happened to someone like me 50 years ago.”</p><h2 id=h-don-callis-doesn-t-observe-tony-khan-s-birthday>Don Callis doesn’t observe Tony Khan’s birthday</h2><p>When asked if he bought anything for Tony Khan’s birthday today, Callis said he doesn’t observe birthdays.</p><p>“I don’t observe birthdays,” Don Callis said. “I don’t observe birthdays of employees. Quote unquote friends. I don’t observe birthdays of children. I think it’s a manufactured holiday to make money, and if I can’t make money off of it, I’m not interested in talking about it.”</p><p><a href=#>Sammy Guevara Turns On Chris Jericho, Aligns With Don Callis On AEW Dynamite</a></p><p>What do you make of Don Callis’ comments?
