While not as well-known as his mother, Zuri does manage to attract some attention every now and then.

Patti and Armstead adopted two sons from their deceased neighbor after Zuri was born.</p><p>Dodd Stocker-Edwards and Stanley Stocker are Zuri’s adopted siblings. After adopting Dodd and Stanley, Zuri’s parents reportedly adopted two additional children, William and Stayce Holte. They were apparently LaBelle’s sister’s children.</p><h2><span id=Patti_LaBelle_Zuri_Kye_Edwards8217_mother_proposed_to_his_father_Armstead_Edwards>Patti LaBelle, Zuri Kye Edwards’ mother, proposed to his father, Armstead Edwards.</span></h2><p>Zuri’s mother, Patti, was the one who proposed marriage to his father, Armstead Edwards.</p><p>Edwards had actually asked Patti to marry him. Zuri’s father did propose to the Stir It Up singer multiple times, but she declined each time. LaBelle eventually asked Armstead to marry her.</p><p>Patti reportedly declined Armstead’s proposal since she was the kid of divorced parents who argued frequently. She was afraid that something similar would happen to her and Edwards.</p><h2><span id=Patti_and_Edwards_Zuri8217s_parents_married_in_Maryland_in_1969_Zuri8217s_father_was_her_manager_before_they_married>Patti and Edwards, Zuri’s parents, married in Maryland in 1969. Zuri’s father was her manager before they married.</span></h2><p>Patti and Edwards had one son, Zuri, and two adoptive sons after their marriage. Some allege they adopted two more children, as previously stated.<br>Divorce of Zuri’s Parents</p><p>Zuri’s parents, LaBelle and Edwards, divorced in 2000 after nearly three decades of marriage. In an interview, Patti stated that she and her husband divorced after realizing they couldn’t live together any longer.</p><p>Even though the marriage was collapsing, the R&B artist noted that things remained really friendly. Following Edwards, it was claimed in 2016 that Patti was privately seeing her then-41-year-old drummer, Eric Seats. The purported pair had allegedly been together for more than a year at the time.</p><p>Patti, Zuri’s mother, appears to be single again, at least according to her Instagram.</p><h2><span id=Zuri_Kye_Edwards_and_his_wife_Lona_Edwards_have_three_children>Zuri Kye Edwards and his wife, Lona Edwards, have three children.</span></h2><p>Zuri, Patti’s son, is married to Lona Edwards and has two daughters, Gia and Leyla, as well as a son, Zuri Jr. Zuri’s daughters, Gia and Leyla, who are still young, have a combined Instagram account.</p><p>Despite the fact that Gia and Leyla occasionally mention their mother Lona on Instagram, nothing is known about Lona Edwards. LaBelle’s son and his family are said to live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><h2><span id=Zuri_Edwards_is_the_manager_of_his_mother8217s_business>Zuri Edwards is the manager of his mother’s business.</span></h2><p>Zuri is currently his mother’s bodyguard and manager. Meanwhile, he appears to have produced a few tunes.</p><p>Zuri has been known as his mother’s manager ever since the publications began to talk about him. As a result, it is unclear what he used to do before then.</p><h2><span id=Zuri_Kye_Edwards_was_once_attacked_at_the_airport>Zuri Kye Edwards was once attacked at the airport.</span></h2><p>In November 2013, the son of singer Patti LaBelle told a Texas jury that a man named Richard King punched him in the face in a Houston airport terminal after the man hurled racial obscenities at his mother.</p><p>According to KTRK-TV in Houston, Edwards testified that King was “intoxicated, loud, and obnoxious” and yelled racial epithets at his mother. Patti’s kid then described how King smacked him on the right side of his face in an instant.</p><p>Following this, Zuri testified that his mother’s bodyguard, Efrem Holmes, struck Richard King at Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2011. Following that, King charged Holmes with misdemeanor assault.</p><p>In contrast, Holmes’ attorneys stated that their client was defending LaBelle and Edwards from King’s onslaught. LaBelle testified in Holmes’ defense as well, describing him as “cuddly, very nice, and very gentle.”</p><p>The Grammy winner and her son had just landed in Houston with Holmes. Edwards was loading bags into an SUV for a journey to a concert at a Louisiana casino, according to Patti, when King barged up to the limousine in which she sat.</p><p>When Patti’s son, Edwards, intervened, King rattled the door handle to try to enter the vehicle and called her slurs. LaBelle stated that King punched Edwards and subsequently was knocked down by Holmes.</p><p>Zuri’s mother claimed that no one was attempting to harm King, but he was the one who began it all. Surveillance video shows Edwards chest-bumping King, taking a blow from King, then slamming King in the face three times. Soon after, LaBelle’s hairstylist came in between the two and began to attack King as well.</p><p>In response, King launched a lawsuit against Patti and Holmes. LaBelle then filed a counter-suit against Richard King.</p><h2><span id=Patti_LaBelle_considers_her_son_Zuri_to_be_her_greatest_accomplishment>Patti LaBelle considers her son, Zuri, to be her greatest accomplishment.</span></h2><p>Patti LaBelle, who was formerly thought to be dead, revealed in August 2021 that her son, Zuri Kye Edwards, is her greatest success in life. LaBelle acknowledges that having her kid, Zuri, was the best thing she’s ever done, despite all of her songs and artistic success.</p><p>The R&B artist stated in an interview with America’s Closer magazine:</p><p>“Having my son was an incredible memory.” I was the senior citizen in the maternity ward! The females were teenagers, and I was 29 years old. ‘Lord, will I ever walk again?’ I asked. Giving birth was a terrifying experience, but it had such a great outcome.”</p><p>LaBelle also stated that while her son can be difficult to work for, she knows that despite their disagreements, he always has her best interests at heart because they are family.</p><p>The Godmother Of Soul said that Zuri occasionally wounds her since he is truthful. Ultimately, LaBelle claims her son provides her the best advise she’s ever received.</p><h2><span id=Zuri_Is_Frequently_Seen_On_His_Daughters8217_Instagram>Zuri Is Frequently Seen On His Daughters’ Instagram</span></h2><p>Despite the fact that the Instagram handle, @gia_edwards, belongs to Zuri’s daughters, Gia and Leyla, the father of two, and Patti’s son, for the most part, is also featured on the image-sharing domain. In fact, it is assumed that Zuri is in charge of his daughters’ social media pages.</p><p>Zuri may be found in practically every other Instagram photo. However, it is unknown whether Kye has any personal cyberspace.</p><h2><span id=Zuri_Kye_Edwards_Net_Worth>Zuri Kye Edwards Net Worth</span></h2><p>Patti LaBelle, Zuri’s singer/actress mother, is a multi-platinum recording artist. She has amassed a reported net worth of more than $60 million thanks to her countless hit recordings and her large personality in the music world for over five decades.</p><p>However, given her son, Zuri’s, clearly less voguish career, the thought of him having his mother-Esque’s net worth appears to be a rather seasoned overstatement. Nonetheless, as the manager of his multimillionaire mother, his wealth is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
