Then, Cochran came back and won a season which was a moment of elation for many fans who thought he was great. However, things went awry after that when Jeff Probst began shoving Cochran down the fan’s throats. For example, Probst brought Cochran up during reunions for no reason. If that wasn’t enough, Probst also made Cochran a prize for a challenge. It was enough to make fans begin to resent Cochran.
