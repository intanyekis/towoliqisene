They are also the only franchise that is valued at under $1 billion ($980 million).</p><p>On top of that, the Marlins were one of two teams (along with the Pittsburgh Pirates) that saw a one-year decrease in value (-2 percent). Jeter's team also had a -$5.9 million operating income.</p><p>Jeter and majority owner Bruce Sherman led the group that purchased the Marlins from Jeffrey Loria in 2017. After taking over, Jeter went about rebuilding the Marlins from scratch - trading away franchise superstar and slugger Giancarlo Stanton, All-Star outfielder Christian Yelich, catcher J.T. Realmuto and versatile infielder Dee Gordon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yankees & Dodgers Top Forbes' MLB Valuations Rankings</a></strong></p><p>In 2018, the first season under Jeter and Sherman, Miami went 63-98 - last in the NL East division. They went a woeful 57-105 in 2019, once again finishing last in the division. But given Jeter's winning experience (five World Series championships with the New York Yankees), Marlins fans should give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>The 2020 MLB season was scheduled to take place on March 26, with all 30 teams in action.
