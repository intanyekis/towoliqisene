She wasn’t in fear with that d–k in her ass for a paycheck,” Wilkinson wrote in her now-deleted posts. “That bitch is in fear now knowing so many of us saw her doing some nasty s–t. She’s embarrassed and in shame. She was the clean up girl … Hollys job was to get Hef hard again and clean him up with her mouth.”</p><p><span>Wilkinson and Madison both rose to fame as the live-in girlfriends of Playboy founder Hefner on E!’s reality series — but<a href=#> their relationship crumbled in 2015 </a>after Madison released her memoir, <i>Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny.</i></span></p><p>Madison<a href=#> exclusively opened up to <i>Us Weekly</i></a> last summer about her stay at the legendary Playboy Mansion, where she revealed many shocking secrets about her former lifestyle. “I don’t know what people think goes on in the bedroom,” Madison told Us at the time. “But it was always very much the same, and intimidating, and not something that I liked. It was a miserable part of my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>The pregnant star, who’s now married to </span><b>Pasquale Rotella,</b><span> also ripped Wilkinson in the same cover story. “I lived with Kendra for four years and I never saw her in the vicinity of a book, so I don’t think she’s going to read it,” she dished to Us. “Maybe she’ll have frenemies fill her in on what it says? But I don’t think she’s going to read it.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span>At the time, Wilkinson memorably rushed to Hefner’s defense, and </span><a href=#>subsequently opened up to <i>Us Weekly</i></a><i></i><span> about the tome. “I just think it’s up to people what they believe,” Wilkinson told Us last August. “The proof is out there on The Girls Next Door. At the end of the day, people made up their minds already if they believe it or not. So I can’t dictate. I can’t manipulate anybody’s minds.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZ6Zv6J51qKjpKGeqLyvedGip6xlmKS5rcWMppidoaOku261zWalrJ6nYsG4scStqmavYmWDc36PaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-most-overrated-tv-nerds-and-5-that-are-underrated.html><span>←</span><span>10 Most Overrated TV Nerds (And 5 That Are Underrated)</span></a>
