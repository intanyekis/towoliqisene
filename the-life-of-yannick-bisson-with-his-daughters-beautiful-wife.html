The wedding of Bisson’s daughter took place in October 2017.</p><p>Mikaela, a cosmetic artist, makes sure to convey her love for her spouse through her swoon-worthy Instagram photos even though he isn’t online. In addition, her father periodically makes an appearance on her social media, indicating a good father-daughter relationship. And most recently, she gave her parents a new addition: her son, Rory Ian Franklin.</p><p>Rory is Yannick’s first grandchild, so he can’t help but regularly show off his adorable little ball on Instagram. Dominique, Yannick’s second child, works in the entertainment business as a camera and electrical department employee. Dominique is 30 years old. She has also worked briefly as an actress and as a celebrity stylist.</p><p>Despite being thirty years old, the woman is still single and living with her lover. She frequently uses her social media accounts to display the treasured times she has with her boyfriend while sharing sneak peeks into her love life.</p><p>While both his daughters, Dominique and Mikaela, chose different paths in life than their father, Brianna is best recognized for her role in Yannick’s Murdoch Mysteries.</p><p>In terms of her current work, she will star in the TV movies Baking All the Way and Albatross, both of which will be released in 2022. The actress turned 25 this year, and her proud father celebrated by showering her with love in a celebratory Instagram post that read,</p><p>“Today is my 25th birthday!!<br>What a blessing and pure joy you are.<br>You arrived completely unannounced, and you were delightful right away.”</p><p>The actor may be having his best life with his beloved wife by his side through every aspect of his life and his three adoring adult daughters.</p><h2><span id=Longtime_Partner_of_Yannick>Longtime Partner of Yannick</span></h2><p>Yannick’s enduring romance began during his time in high school. Yannick Bisson and Shantelle have been together since high school, and their marriage in 1990 strengthened their closeness even further.</p><p>Former fitness teacher Shantelle started working in the entertainment industry as a writer and producer of television programs. Despite having busy schedules, they find time for each other because they both thrive in their different fields.</p><p>Finding time to commemorate their wedding anniversary, Yannick sent the nicest message to the love of his life, reading,</p><p>“Happy Anniversary, lovely you!</p><p>I would repeat the process. You have my undying love. Although I am aware that you have a busy day ahead of you, please know that there are still many experiences in store for us.”</p><p>Yannick’s charming beau, however, does not do any less to show his appreciation for her on social media. On her Instagram, Shantelle posted pictures of her and her hubby having cute moments.</p><p>“With my favorite adventure partner, whether we’re exploring, dining, demolishing old stuff and erecting new stuff, taking in the scenery, or improving the world by giving to those in need…<br>I’m happy to see you.”</p><p>Along with the fact that his personal life is going well, the actor’s commanding screen presence also contributes to his sense of fulfillment.</p><h2><span id=Value_of_Yannick_Bisson>Value of Yannick Bisson</span></h2><p>Undoubtedly, Yannick is one of the most recognizable faces on television.
