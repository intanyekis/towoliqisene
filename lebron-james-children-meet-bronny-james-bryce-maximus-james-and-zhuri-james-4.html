He is among the most powerful and influential athletes in the world. Apart from being a world-class athlete, James is also a very intelligent businessman.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lebron-james-children></span>LeBron James Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>LeBron James has three kids with his wife, Savannah James. They are Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri. LeBron James Jr. goes by Bronny and is the eldest of his children. There have been moments where fans have seen these kids at his games, and especially in championship ceremonies.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-bronny-james-bryce-maximus-james-and-zhuri-james></span>Meet Bronny James, Bryce Maximus James, And Zhuri James<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bronny James is the eldest son of Lebron James. He currently plays as a Point guard for Sierra Canyon High School in Los Angeles. He is currently the 24th ranked player in his high school class and has been labeled a 4-star recruit by ESPN.</p><p>13-year-old Bryce Maximus James is LeBron James’ second oldest child. Like his older brother, Bryce has a keen interest in basketball and has spoken in the past about following in his father’s footsteps. Bryce is also a student of Canyon High School in Los Angeles. He has been playing in the AAU circuit and what would make LeBron James most happy is that already NCAA Division I programs are clamoring to bring him to their school.</p><p>Zhuri James was born in 2014 and is the youngest child of LeBron James and his wife Savannah. Zhuri is already very popular and is often seen in social media posts made by other members of her family, including her world-famous father. She also has a Youtube channel called All Things Zhuri.
