Speaking to Fox, Alston said he came up with the name because he sees bungee jumping as a metaphor for his life. “I had so many ups and downs throughout my life that I felt that was the perfect way to express myself,” he explained to the publication. “I was also aware that everyone else faces ups and downs as well so it would represent us all perfectly.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Bungee Brand’s website, Alston explains he found success in the music industry early on in life. However, as he gained notoriety, he admits he led him to make “some incredibly bad decisions.” Nevertheless, Alston credits his time behind bars for leading him to find his passion for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sneaker design</a>.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC 7 News</a>, Alston admits he never saw himself dabbling in the fashion industry. In fact, the idea came to him by chance. He tried sketching a pair of sneakers out of boredom one day, and when it turned out well, he continued with the hobby. Shortly after, he realized his talent and passion for design. But even after being released after his six plus years behind bars six years ago, success didn’t find him immediately. Alston initially got a job as a hairdresser, but he focused his finances into starting his business. Now, his brand is thriving.</p><p>During his interview with Fox, Alston said he hopes his brand sets an example for “the youth and disenfranchised.” He wants to show people that second chances are possible, if you put your mind to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bungee Brand’s sneakers range in price from $250 to $500 per pair. The designer footwear is currently being produced in Italy and Portugal. The brand makes both men and women’s footwear. Bungee Brand has also expanded to include clothing, including sweatshirts and t-shirts.
