Mrs. Crisp departed on October 12, 2023, succumbing to injuries sustained in a tragic automobile accident. Born on April 15, 1956, in Joliet, Illinois, she was the daughter of the late Len Earl Sparks and Rachel Mann Sparks. A cherished member of the Pennville Church of Christ, Delaine was known for her artistic talents, particularly her skill in carving, with a specialization in Santa Clauses.</p><p>Her passion for crafts extended to embroidery, crochet, and drawing. She shared these joys with her daughters during their outings to yard sales and thrift stores. Delaine selflessly contributed to her community as a Nursery class teacher at the Pennville Congregation. Preceding her in death were her daughter, Lori Annette McWhorter, brother, Jack Sparks, and her father-in-law & mother-in-law, William “Cherry” Crisp & Pauline Crisp. Delaine is survived by her devoted husband, Nolan; daughter and son-in-law, Misty & Robert McQuese; son-in-law, Anthony McWhorter; and grandchildren, Noah McQuese, Eli McQuese, Will McWhorter, Owen McWhorter, and Ava McQuese.</p><p>Funeral services to celebrate Delaine’s life will be held on October 14, 2023, at 2:00 P.M. at the Pennville Church of Christ, officiated by Minister Robby Eversole. Interment will follow at the West Hill Cemetery. Pallbearers, including family members and close friends, will carry her with the respect she deserves.</p><p>The family will receive friends at the Pennville Church of Christ on Saturday, October 14, 2023, from 12:00 Noon until 2:00 P.M., where Delaine will lie in state. In honor of her memory, honorary pallbearers include Jeff & Kathy Bennett, Johnny & Kay Brimer, Mike & Janice Bowers, Leslie & Freda Shadrick, Randy & Beverly Young, and the Ladies of the Pennville Church of Christ. As we remember and mourn the loss of Mrs. Rachel Delaine Crisp, may we find solace in the cherished memories she leaves behind and the impact she made on the lives of those around her.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwudGsZKuZk52yrXnDnqOaoZ6aerCuyK2smqqpYr%2Bmv8idnKesXaSzbq%2FRoqqpZaSntrC6jKCYZqCRqHqxrdKsnJ1lkayuunnFrqWeqpGheqWx05qgpatf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-k-kanye-west-wear-matching-acid-wash-jeans-airport-style-photos-w207223.html><span>←</span><span>Kim K., Kanye West Wear Matching Acid Wash Jeans: Airport Style Photos</span></a>
