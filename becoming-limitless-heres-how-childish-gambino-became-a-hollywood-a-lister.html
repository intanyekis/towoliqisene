Born Donald McKinley Glover Jr. on September 25, 1983, in California, the now 38-year-old has made effective use of every talent he was given at birth, which has helped to align him with some of the most popular names in the <a href=#>entertainment industry</a>. Some may call him a Jack of all trades, but he has definitely mastered some, including that of a writer, actor, rapper, singer, comedian, director, and producer. With all those hats to wear, one might imagine that his net worth would be more inflated than his ego, and you would be correct. Let's discover how Childish Gambino secured a $35 million net worth as a multitalented star.</p><h2 id=a-passion-for-the-arts>A Passion For The Arts</h2><p>From the OVO Founder Drake to <a href=#>Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson,</a> every music artist, even directors, and producers in the Hollywood film industry knows how valuable a writer is. Numerous fans would be disappointed to find out that their favorite music artists don't write their own songs. But for Glover, under the stage name Childish Gambino, this would never be his concern. Raised by his father, Donald Sr., and his mother Beverly, he developed a passion for the arts at an early age and graduated from the New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 2006 with a degree in Dramatic Writing. Around this time, he also developed an interest in <a href=#>DJing and mixing </a>electronic sounds under the name MC DJ, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=writing-and-television-acting-career>Writing And Television Acting Career</h2><p>Fans across the globe are probably more familiar with Gambino as a rapper because music entertainers tend to receive more recognition and clout. However, the first line of work his talents graced was script writing and acting. After writing a speculative script for The Simpsons, he gained the recognition of Brooklyn Nine-Nine television producer David Miner and <a href=#>Hollywood actress/comedian Tina Fey</a>. Being impressed with his work, they hired him as a writer for the NBC sitcom, 30 Rock, from 2006 to 2009. Glover also made a few cameo appearances on the show, which featured future Hollywood stars such as comedian Tracy Morgan, Alec Baldwin, and Jane Krakowski.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a testament to his writing brilliance, in 2008 the writing team earned the Writer's Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Series following its third season, where it also generated 8.5 million viewers - the most ever.&nbsp;At only 23, his greatest successes were yet to come.</p><p>In the same year, he auditioned to play <a href=#>President Barack Obama </a>on the sketch comedy show, Saturday Night Live, but actor Fred Armisen was preferred over him. One year later in 2009, he landed a role on another NBC sitcom called Community which he appeared in for only five episodes. Rumors suggested that he left the show to work on his rap career, which later materialized. But before delving into his career as a rap artist, here are the films he both directed and starred in.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>The Lion King Passes Frozen As The Highest-Grossing Animated Film Ever</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=film-acting-and-directing>Film Acting And Directing</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Showbiz CheatSheet</a>, Gambino has also landed roles in some major movie titles in addition to directing his own masterpieces.
